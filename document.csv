dbxivrcy,"Evaluate your habits.  If you are trying to improve your willpower, it’s likely that your lack of impulse control is adversely affecting some area of your life.  Some people struggle with willpower across their lives, while others have one specific “weakness” when it comes to willpower.  Determine the area you would like to improve; if you have several different areas to improve, you may want to address one at a time.
For example, you may find it difficult to have willpower when it comes to eating.  This can affect your overall health and quality of life.
For example, you might have difficulty with controlling your spending habits, making it difficult to save money for “big” or important items or events. Make a willpower scale.  Create your own scale for evaluating your willpower. You might make it a 1-10 scale, where 1 is a complete indulgence in the exact thing(s) you are trying to avoid, and 10 is a stoic adherence to strict rules you’ve set for yourself.  Or you can make a simpler scale of “none, a little, more, a lot.”  The scale can take on different forms, but it offers an opportunity for you to evaluate yourself.
For example, if you find yourself hoarding sweets and sneaking to the fast food drive-thru window every day, you may give yourself a 1 or 2 on a 1-10 scale.
If you impulse-buy items that you do not really need because they are on sale, or if you shop online and spend money on things you don’t really need just because you’re bored, you might give yourself a “none” on a shopping-restraint willpower scale. Set a long-term goal for change. The first step towards self-improvement is setting a goal for change.  Your goal should be clear, specific, and attainable. If a goal is too vague or not measurable, it will be difficult to determine whether you’ve met or made progress towards your goal.
For example, a too-vague goal related to impulsive eating is “eat healthier.”  Healthier is relative, and it will be difficult to know when you have arrived at “healthier.”  A more concrete goal could be “lose 40 pounds through healthy eating,” “fit into a size 8 dress again,” or even “eliminate my dependence on sugar.”
A too-vague goal related to spending is “be better with money.” Again, this is not clear or measurable.  A better goal would be “save 10% of every paycheck,” “build up my savings account to $3000,” or “pay off my credit cards to a $0 balance.” Set shorter-term sub-goals. One of the best ways to work towards a large goal (which may seem overwhelming) is to set short-term guidepost goals along the way.  Short-term goals should also be specific and measurable, and they should lead you towards your ultimate long-term goal.
For example, if you are trying to lose 40 pounds, you may want to make your first short-term goal(s) “lose 10 pounds,” “exercise 3 times per week,” and/or “limit dessert to one time per week.”
If you are trying to save $3000, you might make your first short-term goal(s) “save $500,” “limit eating out to twice per week,” and/or “have our weekly movie night at home instead of at the movie theatre.”"
onqtnlsj,"Know that your past does not define your future. You may have had some downs, some failed grades or poor relationships - this does not mean that you will fail every exam you ever take or have poor relationships for the rest of your life. Acknowledge any role that you may have played in these and also look at other factors that may have been at play.
The point of this is not to point fingers or lay blame on any one. Understand that you have some control over the quality of your life. Learn from your mistakes. Look at things that may have gone wrong in the past and look at your behavior then and now. Forgive yourself. Are there any lessons that you can draw from them? Write them down. Is there anything you’re doing that you know will have consequences that you will regret later? Instead, do something that will be of benefit to you later, or at the very least will not cause any harm.
You will have to exercise some discipline. It’s easy to repeat behavior just because it’s familiar, it’s what you’re used to doing in a particular situation. For example, if you’re used to eating lots of sweet things and now you have diabetes, it will take time to adjust to your eating habits. Move on. Take the lessons you’ve learned, and carry on with life. As your past defined your present, your present will define your future. What you do now, will affect your future.
Allow yourself to fully feel any grievance you may have for the past. For a friendship that went sour or for a project you set out to do that didn’t work out the way you wanted. Write about it or discuss it with someone you trust. Express your view on the matter and why you’re upset about it. This will help you better understand your situation.
Accept that what’s done is done and that you can only deal with the here and now. Forgive yourself for your mistakes and if you can, make amends with others.
Internalizing this may take longer than a day. Your choices, habits and behavior in the past made who you are today. It will take time to cultivate new habits that will make who you are tomorrow."
gckbliud,"Identify how your friend is annoying you. What exactly is your friend doing that is getting on your nerves? Is your friend too clingy? Does your friend gossip or say mean things to you? Is your friend constantly making fun of you? Are you just annoyed by your friend for no reason?
The source of the annoyance will help you figure out what you need to do.
If your friend is too clingy, you need to create space between the two of you.
If your friend is being mean and hurtful towards you, you should let them know how you feel.
If you cannot identify why you are so annoyed with your friend, you might need to do some self-evaluation. Have you changed or outgrown your friend?
Try to think about what you'd like your friendship to look like. Is it currently up to your standards? Spend time together in a group. Instead of spending time alone with your friend, only see them when other people are around. This can create a buffer between the two of you. You will not have to talk to your friend as much. If your friend starts being annoying, you will still have other people you can talk to.
Make sure that other people are around when you hang out with your annoying friend. For example, make plans with some other friends and then invite the annoying friend to come along or eat lunch with a group of people instead of just you and your friend.
If your friend invites you to go somewhere and you know it will only be the two of you, decline the offer or ask if you can bring someone else along. Limit the amount of contact you have. If you want to maintain the friendship, you can create some space between the two of you. This will give you a break from the person and send a signal to the person to change their behavior.
If the person calls and/or texts too much, do not respond to them every single time. Only answer when you feel like it or really want to talk to them.
If you have to call them back, call them when you are about to do something else. This way you can keep the conversation short. For example, you could call and say, ""Hey, I saw your missed call. I'm about to eat dinner with my family, what's up?""
Setting boundaries is a good, important thing to do in your friendship. Ignore the person when they annoy you. Your friend may be engaging in certain behaviors because they enjoy the response and attention you give. Your friend may say negative things or complain a lot to get sympathy and attention from you. Your friend may make fun of other people to get laughs. By responding, you may actually be encouraging the annoying behavior.
The person may eventually stop the behavior if you ignore them.
For example, if your friend is always making fun of others to get laughs, stop laughing and do not respond at all when they make a comment.
If other friends have noticed the annoying behaviors, all of you should stop responding.
When you ignore the person, do not roll your eyes or make a face. This is still a reaction to what the person is doing. You may also hurt your friend's feelings if you are rude. Encourage your friend to have other interests. If you have a clingy friend, encourage them to try a new hobby or spend time with other people. This will take some of the pressure of off you. Your friend will be less annoying to you when you spend time together.
You may tell your friend, ""I love being friends with you, but I think we should try to meet new people too.""
If your friend tells you about an activity they did without you, tell them how great that is and you are proud of them.
You can also suggest specific activities for your friend to do. Choose activities that your friend is interested in, but you are not interested in. For example, if your friend likes to draw but you do not, find an art class or art exhibit and tell your friend about it."
vftthyjl,"Secure a place to live. Perhaps the first step you should take when making preparations to leave home is to secure a place to live. Ultimately, without a place to live, you’ll have a tough time managing a job, school, or anything else in your life. As a result, make this search a priority.
Talk to friends or family in the area where you plan on living.
Search online websites that are dedicated to real estate rentals or sales.
Contact a Realtor or a property management firm in the area you’ll be moving to find a suitable place to buy or rent.
If you’re a student, contact your college or university for a list of recommended student housing solutions. You might consider an on-campus dormitory.
Think about enlisting potential roommates. You might also think about renting or subletting a room from someone who already has a home. Having roommates will drastically cut down the cost of renting a home.
Find out exactly what date you’ll be able to move into your new home. Set up your utilities. After you’ve got a place to live and know when you can move in, you need to set up your utilities. Without setting up your utilities, it will be very hard to function in your new home.
Important utilities you need to think about usually include: electricity, water, and cable and internet. Depending on your region and municipality you might also need to consider a natural gas provider, trash pickup, and sewer service.
Ask your landlord or real estate agent about the utility companies that serve the property you’ll be living on.
If you’re moving in with someone who already has utilities set up, talk to that person about how utilities will be split.
Contact all of your utility providers and arrange a day for them to turn the utilities on.
If you’re starting new service, you may need to pay a deposit or connection fee. Line up transportation. Now that you’ve got a home and utilities ready to roll, you will need to arrange for transportation for your move. Depending on your circumstances, you’ll need to arrange travel and transportation to your new home. Either way, it is important to think about transportation as soon as you can.
If you’re moving and have a lot of stuff to bring with you (like furniture), you’ll need to look into renting a moving truck. Make sure you measure your furniture and other things you’ll be moving, so that you will have enough space.
If you’re moving and don’t have a lot of stuff, you might just be able to move it in a car, SUV, or a truck. Use your own vehicle, or a friend or family member’s to move your stuff.
If you’re just moving across town, consider moving your stuff slowly over the course of a few weeks. Try to line up a support network. One important thing to have as you move out of the home is a support network. Whether you’re moving far from home, or just around the corner, you should invest some time in making sure that you’ll have friends and family available to support you emotionally (and to socialize with). This is important, as without a support network, you may feel isolated.
If you’re going off to college, there is a good chance you might know a few people who are going to the same school. Try to get their contact information ahead of time, so you’ll be able to meet up with them.
Even if you’re just moving across town, try to get a handle of how far your friends and family will be. Also, see if you have any friends and family close to where you’ll be living. Just having someone 10 minutes away could make a world of difference.
If you’re moving to a town or city where you don’t know anyone, consider joining social clubs or similar groups in order to make friends. Pack your belongings. After you’ve lined everything up, you’ll need to pack up all your belongings. Next to physically moving your stuff, packing can be one of the most stressful things you’ll deal with. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time and think about what you need to take.
Buy plenty of boxes to pack your stuff.
Pack systematically. Move through your dressers and bedroom furniture piece-by-piece. Don’t forget anything.
Make piles or stacks of like-kind items. If you’ve got games spread out, put all of your games together before you put them into a box."
bogrddvw,"Try to understand why you're tempted. When you're thinking about what it is you want to avoid, it can help to try to identify the underlying thoughts or feelings that lead to that behavior. Those are different for everyone, but impulsive behaviors often happen when you're trying to cover up some uncomfortable thoughts or feelings.
For example, you may be more likely to drink after you have a conversation with a difficult family member.
If you can figure out this pattern, it might help you be proactive in avoiding the self-destructive behavior. Recognize potential temptation. Temptation is all about self-control, and tempting situations are often about the conflict between immediate gratification and long-term goals. For example, if you're on a diet, you may be tempted to eat a delicious piece of cheesecake that's beckoning you from the deli case. Immediate gratification would result from giving in to temptation and eating the cheesecake. However, giving in would also interfere with your long-term goal of becoming more healthy by avoiding high-sugar foods.
As another example, if you're already in a relationship, become aware of people that might tempt you to cheat. These people may be old acquaintances that have come back into your life, your co-workers, or people that you interact with in private settings.
However, temptation isn't always this obvious. For example, say you're a business professional and you're tempted to knock off early on a Friday afternoon a few days a month. A couple of early departures don't seem like a big deal, but this could represent to your employer that you can't be trusted with responsibility, which could jeopardize long-term goals such as promotion and advancement. Remove yourself from temptation. Make it easier to deal with temptation by getting away from what tempts you. For instance, if you're trying to quit smoking, avoid places that you frequently smoked. You may even want to avoid people that you usually smoked with.
If you're tempted to drink, the annual work party at the bar will probably challenge your determination. Stay alert for potential temptations and avoid them when possible. This way, you won't be caught off-guard and you'll always be prepared to deal with temptations.
If you can't completely remove yourself from a situation or person, try to manage the situation so that it's more difficult to act on your temptation. For example, if you're tempted to cheat with a friend, avoid one-on-one situations. Always meet in a group, if you have to see the person. Be honest. If you're refusing something or someone that's tempting you, don't feel guilty or like you need to lie. Be honest about why you're refusing something. This can strengthen your resolve in the future and may even reduce the temptation.
For example, if you're tempted to cheat and the person you're interested in asks you out, honestly refuse her by saying you're already in a relationship. Once she knows this, she may be less likely to flirt with you in the future. Visualize yourself resisting temptation. In this approach, picture yourself acknowledging or touching the temptation before putting it down and walking away from it. Imagine this experience in as much detail as you can. For example, if you're trying to avoid sweets, imagine holding a chocolate bar. Picture smelling it, touching it, and putting it down.
Once you've practiced enough, you may even purposely try to resist the temptation. Go to the store and confront your temptation. This technique is not appropriate for addictions, such as drug or alcohol addictions. Visualization of giving in or contact with paraphernalia can act as a trigger and make resistance to this temptation much harder. Think of the long-term consequences. It's easy to think of immediate gratification when you really want something. Take a minute to think of the longer term consequences before giving in to temptation. In some cases, such as cheating on a partner, the long-term consequences are extensive and often extreme. You will hurt your partner, you will damage that person's trust in you, and you may even lose the relationship. However, we're beset all the time with what researchers call ""epsilon-cost temptations,"" or those little things that don't seem consequential on their own but add up to significant consequences. People often have a harder time refusing these temptations because they seem so minor.
For example, trying a single cigarette or eating a single slice of cheesecake are not likely to have immediate, long-term, extensive negative consequences. However, smoking that cigarette makes you more likely to have another, and another, which increases your overall risk of highly negative consequences. And even a single cigarette can cause immediate damage to your body and raise your risk of diseases such as cancer.
Try to consider your actions in a broader context. A single slice of cheesecake won't kill you, but if you're trying to avoid sugar to become healthier, eating it will hold you back from that long-term goal. The extra calories will also add up over time if you keep giving in. Thinking about things this way, instead of as isolated incidents, can help improve self-control.
You may even find that visualizing the long-term consequences can help you build your resistance. For example, if you're tempted to smoke, visualize yourself as a cancer patient hooked up to chemotherapy. Visualize how terrible you feel, how expensive your treatments have been, and how heartbroken your family is. Distract yourself. Sometimes, fixating on what's tempting you can make it harder to resist. Instead, research has shown that distracting yourself by doing something fun or that engages your mind can help fight temptation. You might try meditating, yoga, going for a jog, or meeting up with friends. Whatever you choose to do to distract yourself, throw yourself into it completely.
You may want to do something that engages you with others who need help. Shift the focus of your attention away from yourself to people who'd appreciate you. It may take your mind off of the temptation.
Having a specific ""distraction plan"" is a good idea. For example, tell yourself that if you notice the urge for a cigarette, you will get up and go for a short run. This will act as a distraction and improve your health, too. Do not give yourself a choice. If you're tempted by something, don't let yourself believe that you have the choice to give in or avoid it. If you remove choice from the situation, you'll have to refuse whatever's tempting you.
For example, if you're feeling tempted to cheat on your partner, avoid flirting with a co-worker that you're interested in. Since you know you don't want to cheat, don't even act like you're interested.
As another example, if you're struggling to stay on your low-sugar eating plan given you by your doctor, you could refuse invitations to holiday parties that are likely to be full of sweets and rich foods. However, this option also limits your ability to socialize and interact with others, so consider whether this is the route you really want to take."
fhxejbco,"Be mindful of your noise level at all times. Controlling your noise level is the biggest part of behaving. If you are having trouble maintaining an appropriate volume, stop and take a deep breath when you feel yourself getting louder. Collect your thoughts and convey what you want to say in a respectful and reserved manner. Pay attention to your noise level and you can better control it.
Try to limit what you're saying to who you're saying it to. You rarely have to say something to an entire group. Know who you're talking to, and speak with a voice loud enough that they can hear you.
Ask yourself if you really have to say something before you say it. If it's not necessary to the conversation, don't say it. Practice this technique regularly.
Listen to how loud the people around you are. Match their sound level.
If people are staring at you or reacting negatively, adjust your behavior. You should aim to fit in with whatever room you're in.
Don't draw unnecessary attention to yourself. If you try to dominate a room, you'll usually end up rubbing people the wrong way. Practice self-control in all aspects of your life by setting goals and sticking to them. Make your goals specific and long-term. Psychology studies have shown that abstract, big-picture thinking leads to self-control. Instead of focusing on the moment, look toward bigger goals like success in school or sports. Focusing on the future will help you behave in the present.
Being goal-oriented will teach you the art of self-denial. If you get the desire for a soda or to slack off and play video games, deny yourself. Start with small goals like denying yourself ice cream on weekdays. Move up to harder goals like making the starting basketball team. Stick with your goals and soon enough you'll be in total control of your thoughts and actions.
Write down you goals and hang them up where you can see them regularly. Remind yourself of your goals regularly.
Make behavioral goals too. Commit to behaving yourself in public and not having any unintended outbursts.
Keep your goals positive. Get straight A's, keep practicing guitar until you're comfortable enough to play a gig, or exercise four times a week. Stick to your goals religiously.
Make sure your goals are specific. Vague goals are much easier to forget about.
When you are tempted to break a promise or a goal, take a deep breath and think about why you set the goal in the first place. That long term commitment is more important than your momentary impulse.
Try setting up a punishment and reward system for yourself. If you go a week sticking to a strict diet, give yourself a ""cheat day."" Likewise, if you decide to skip a workout, make up for it by working out twice as long the next day. Practices like these will lead to control over your desires and actions.
Make specific long-term goals with specific short-term ways to achieve them. Pay careful attention to rules and social norms, and restrain yourself when you get the urge to break them. Part 2 has more specific information on this, but generally speaking, be conscious of the rules in any social situation. Keep them in the back of your head. Whenever you start to break one, practice self control. Take a deep breath and remember that you have the strength and self-control to stop yourself.
Make a mental list of the rules of any social situation. Take note of all the rules before you even say anything.
If the rules are unclear, be passive and see how other people are acting. Aim to mimic their behavior. If the atmosphere is appropriate for lewd humor and loud talking, you would not be misbehaving by joining in. If the atmosphere is more professional, conduct yourself formally. If the atmosphere is relaxed, let go more but still watch your noise level.
Calming techniques like deep breathing usually work best for self-control, but find what works best for you. Maybe if you're about to break a rule, you can snap your fingers or pinch yourself. Whatever it is, have a method to stop yourself when you get the urge to break a rule. Be careful with your language. Suit your words to the situation, and choose those words carefully. In most situations, cursing and loud bickering is inappropriate. Avoid pointless arguments and critical statements. Generally speaking, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. If you find yourself starting to say something mean or inappropriate, stop yourself before it's too late. If you can't stop yourself, be sure to apologize after.
More relaxed or even crude language is sometimes appropriate if you're with close friends. Be sure you know the situation before you start talking though.
Around coworkers, teachers, or bosses, be very careful with your language. Be humble and understanding, and never curse or start fights.
Compliments and kind words are always appreciated.
If you find yourself wanting to say something mean, write it down instead. Just don't let anybody see what you write!
Don't interrupt people. Let them finish what they're saying before you speak.
Think before you speak. Thoughtless words can get you into trouble. Get in the habit of asking yourself if you're sure you want to say something before you say it."

rflqiiwl,"Act more rationally. In your youth, it's more excusable for you to behave recklessly or out of self interest. However, as you enter adulthood, a big part of your responsibility will involve thinking and acting rationally.
Rational thought requires you to distinguish between thinking and feeling.
A rational person exercises control over his or her emotions, and acts based on thoughts instead of feelings.
Rational thought takes outside interests and moral concerns into consideration during the decision-making process.
To act rationally, try taking a breather when you feel your emotions running high. Come back to the decision when you're calmer and more capable of thinking critically about the issue.
Any time you exercise restraint based on thoughts and moral/ethical considerations, you are acting rationally. With practice, acting rationally can become more natural to your decision-making process. Develop meaningful, balanced relationships. As you learn to live a more grown up adult life, a big part of your focus should be on how you interact with and treat the people around you. Your relationships - which includes friendships, familial ties, and romantic relationships - should be meaningful, balanced, and healthy for all parties involved. This can take a lot of work, but it's essential if you want to be happy and make the people closest to you happy.
Whether dealing with friendships or romantic relationships, you should be able to interact with one another as independent individuals.
Be willing to negotiate things so that everyone is happy.
Every adult relationship requires you to give and take a little. The important thing is that everyone's needs are met.
A balanced relationship involves giving and receiving love unconditionally. Your affection should not be dependent upon certain conditions or expectations. Prioritize your needs over your desires. One of the things many people struggle with when it comes to entering adulthood is putting off things you want in favor of things you need to do. It's okay to spend some money on fun things when you have cash leftover, but you need to prioritize and take care of the essentials first.
Identify your needs and your wants. You may have assumed that something was a necessity, but it's worth re-evaluating all of your expenses to see which items can be put on hold until you have extra spending money.

Set up a budget and track your expenses. Make sure you're never spending more than your total income in a given month.
Take care of essential expenses first. Before you spend money on anything else, make sure you have enough for rent, car payments, insurance, utilities, and groceries.
Set aside an emergency fund. Whether you experience a medical emergency, a car maintenance problem, or need to replace a broken appliance, you'll be glad that you tucked away a little money every week instead of spending it all on pleasure purchases.
Plan for medical expenses. Hopefully this isn't a pressing issue, but it's good to have a little money set aside for doctor's visits, prescription medications, and other health-related expenses.
Dine in instead of going out. It costs far more to purchase prepared food than it does to buy the ingredients and make it at home, plus it's likely to be much healthier if you make it in your own kitchen.
If you have money left over after taking care of your mandatory expenses and putting away money in savings, then you can treat yourself to something fun. Even if it's ""leftover"" money, though, it's important to continue living within your means and prioritizing how you spend that cash. Take control of your life. One of the biggest aspects of being a grown up is taking control of the life you're living. In childhood and adolescence, your parents and family members may have been able to help you out in many different ways, but in adulthood you'll need to learn how to do things yourself.
If there is some aspect of your life that you're not satisfied with (or that others have told you is problematic), be willing to address those issues.
A grown up is capable of assessing her own life and making the changes necessary to lead a fulfilling and rewarding life.
It's okay to ask for help from time to time, but as an adult you should be able to support yourself and sustain your life independent of other people.
Recognize that no one can change your life but you. Though circumstances may limit how much you can change things, you need to be aware that you have the power to adapt and grow no matter what is happening around you.
Start by making and striving towards goals, being independent, and taking responsibility for your actions or inactions."
nxouwlrv,"Identify the project's goals. Take the time to describe the purpose of your project and what it will achieve. Write this on a whiteboard, computer document, or paper in a couple of sentences. Make the description as specific and easy to understand as possible.
One way to do this is to pretend you're writing a launch announcement for the finished product. Envision what the project will be like when you're done with it.
For example,”build a house” is a very basic description. “Build a 3-bedroom glass beach house” is more descriptive and useful. Create a to-do list with the tasks you need to tackle. Come up with ways to accomplish the project's goals. Start with the big steps and list them under your goal. This will give you a basic idea of what you need to do. Break these steps down into smaller ones to make them more actionable.
It can be helpful to start with your vision of the final project and identify what you need to do to make it a reality.
For example, if you're building a website, you need to make graphics, provide coding, and write the page's text.
An actionable step might be, “Apply a filter to the picture of the elephant, then post it to the website.” Go over the list with your team. Let your team look at the list and give their opinions. Many times they'll come up with more small steps needed to accomplish the ones you listed. Sharing these steps also ensures that everyone working on the project is on the same page.
One way to do this is to create a mind map. To do this, first list the large tasks, then draw ""branches"" linking them to smaller steps and ideas. Be sure to take a picture of the map or save the paper. Estimate the time requirement and cost of each step. Go back to each of the steps you listed and calculate what resources you'll use accomplishing them. Your guess won't be 100% accurate, but it should give you a sense of what is needed to finish the project. Remember that tasks your group hasn't done before take up extra time and money, so account for this.
You can research how much time and money a task takes by searching online and asking people who have done it before. For example, an expert coder can tell you how long it takes to create a new program for your website.
It can be helpful to allocate a set amount of time to tasks that can go on indefinitely. For example, write, “We'll spend up to 20 hours creating the graphical layout.”
If you're unsure of a step's costs, you can list how much time and money you're willing to set aside to complete the step. For example, write, “This section of our game world must be done within 2 months and cost less than $1,000.” Organize the tasks into a timeline. Now go back to your big list of steps and rearrange the steps into a working order. You can group the tasks into stages with deadlines, which is useful for keeping your team on track.
For example, when building a website, project stages or milestones might be building, designing, and testing.
When you complete a milestone or stage, it can be helpful to acknowledge your team's work. Send them an encouraging message, buy them doughnuts, or by doing something else that inspires them. Assign tasks to the project participants. Decide which tasks your group members will work on. To do this, talk to each person to find their strengths and areas of expertise. You can also divide up some of the responsibility by having project members volunteer for different parts.
For example, you'd most likely want a graphics artist handling the project's visual aspect. You might then assign construction work to someone else."

Ohio, Indiana, New Mexico, and a few other states will allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if they will be 18 by the general election."
thuvrlvx,"Try mind mapping. To brainstorm and organize ideas for your project, make a mind map to stimulate new thoughts. Use a plain piece of paper, poster board, or whiteboard for your mind map and write the goal of your project in the middle. Write down related topics, subtopics, and relevant concepts around the goal, and branch out from them to create and follow different tangents.
For instance, if your goal is to “provide a comprehensive account of the history of the fur trade in North America”, subtopics and tangents could include “relations with Natives”, “history of European fashion”, and “the cultural significance of fur”. Discuss things in a group. If you are doing a group project, brainstorming things together will allow each group member to feed off of the ideas of others and gain new insight. Schedule a brainstorming session in a quiet place with few distractions. If you are working on a project on your own, group discussion with friends or colleagues can help you gain a new perspective on the topic you’re covering.  Remember to include everybody in any decision-making. Plot out your research. Plan out the process of your research by using the gap filling brainstorming technique. To do this, identify where you are starting from in terms of your knowledge and resources (i.e. Point A), and identify where you want to go with your project (Point B). Make a list of all of the things missing between Point A and Point B and make a plan for filling in this gap.
For instance, if Point A is starting a project about electric cars with limited knowledge on the topic, and Point B is completing a PowerPoint presentation about them, you can fill the gap by conducting research (online and in a library), outlining the history, technology, and possible future of electric cars,  and procuring pictures and news articles about them."
jjehmesx,"Mindful breathing has been proven to lessen impulsive behaviors. A UCLA research study showed that a yoga-based breathing program called Sudarshan Kriya resulted in a significant decrease of impulsive behaviors among teens. The breathing exercises include four basic types of breathing:
Ujjayi or “Victorious Breath”, which is a type of slow, intentional breathing where focus is on the breath touching the throat.
Bhastrika or “Bellows Breath,” in which breath is exhaled forcefully through nostrils, followed by a rapid inhale, at the rate of 30 breaths per minute.
Chanting “Om” 3 times in a row, which requires sustained, controlled expiration.
Breathing in a rhythmic pattern, whether slow, medium or fast."
mbemryrx,"Confront your friend about the abuse.  Oftentimes, abusive friends are unaware they are being abusive.  Perhaps they are just having an off day or made a rude comment without thinking about it.  In these cases, or when your friend is only rarely abusive, you can try to reason with them.  
If you want to meet the friend in person, bring another friend who has been apprised of the situation with you.  They will defend you and could act as mediator in the event that the abusive friend reacts badly.
You are not obligated to confront your abusive friend in person.  You could also write them an email or call them on the phone in order to have a conversation about why you don’t appreciate their abuse.
Draw attention to their negative behavior by using “I” statements such as “I do not like being called stupid.”  Avoid accusatory “you” statements in the form of “You always call me stupid.”
Be polite but firm when telling your friend that you will not tolerate their abuse.  Say, “I treat you with respect, and I expect the same.”
Be as serious as possible.  Smiling or laughing about their abuse will send the message that you are not very upset by their behavior. Refocus the conversation on them.  Abusive friends habitually point out how wrong or inadequate you are.  They communicate in abusive or domineering ways, and make you the center of the conversation.  Responding to this type of communication can be difficult.  The best way to take back control of the conversation is to focus on their abusive behavior or speech instead of any shortcomings that they perceive in you.  
Ask questions that could lead them to rethink their abusive approach.  If your friend calls you names or bullies you, tell them, “Please do not call me names.  Don’t I deserve the same level of respect I give you?”
You could also say to your friend, “If you continue to speak to me without regard for my feelings, I am going to leave.  Is that what you want?” Be honest about your feelings.  You might feel hurt or angry.  That’s okay!  As long as you express your feelings in a positive, healthy way, there’s no reason not to feel a certain way.  Don’t hide your emotions or pretend you aren’t bothered by your abusive friend’s behavior.
Tell your abusive friend, “I don’t like the way you’re talking to me,” or “The things you’re saying are very hurtful.”
Share your feelings about your abusive friend with other family and friends, too.  They might be more willing to listen to you than the abusive friend is. Use humor to cope with your friend’s abuse.  Making a joke can make you feel better and might draw your friend’s attention to his or her abusive behavior without the awkward confrontation that might otherwise occur.  For instance, if your friend is criticizing you for being stupid and they just mentioned they failed a test, you could reply, “You just failed your math test, but I’m stupid?  Really?”
Humor can give you a feeling of greater control over the situation.
Use humor only in cases of mild abuse. Inform your friend of the consequences for serious abuse.  If you have a serious, long-term problem with an abusive friend, let them know what you intend to do in order to correct their behavior.  The types of consequences you enact will vary depending on the situation.
If you work alongside your abusive friend, tell them they need to cease their abuse or you’ll inform the human resources department or department manager of the abuse.
If dealing with an abusive friend at school, tell them you’ll get your teacher or principal involved unless they stop abusing you.
If dealing with a friend who won’t stop harassing you online, tell them you intend to block them and will contact the forum or website administrator to have their abusive content removed."
ngthytvs,"Think about why you want to discipline yourself. Is there a particular goal you're trying to achieve but you feel certain obstacles are getting in the way?  Maybe you want to become an early riser, but have a habit of sleeping really late.  Maybe your once-stellar musical skills are deteriorating because of lack of practice. Or perhaps you're trying to lose weight, but don't like to exercise. Set some time aside to think through this so that you can narrow down your goal-setting. Visualize your goal. Visualization is key to successful goal-setting. For one, you must think clearly about your goals and clarify what they look like. Then, you must surround yourself - either physically or mentally - with these goals.
One specific form of visualization that has been shown to be very effective at helping you reach goals is called process simulation. This tactic involves envisioning yourself taking the necessary steps to accomplish a goal, rather than just imagining the end result.
Other ways to practice visualization can be done through daily meditation or by creating a vision board of your goals. Create an action plan. This can be done in table form, either by hand or by using a PC package such as MS Word or Excel.  Don't worry about filling it in at this point. That's next! Consider adding a relevant goal title at the top of this form, such as Workout Regularly. After doing that add the following column headings in sequence:
Action
Time to Begin
Potential Problems
Strategies to Overcome Potential Problems
Progress Report
Once done, fill in the column boxes under the appropriate headings. Prepare to take action and decide when to begin. Actions will be the steps you must attempt to work towards your goal. After you come up with some meaningful action steps. think of a time to start your new self-discipline goal.
Your action steps could be anything from limiting time spent on unproductive activities that keep you from completing your workout, or making sure your gym clothes are already laid out the night before.
If thinking of ideas is something you are finding difficult, brainstorming is a helpful technique for this. You might also find that asking a family relative, friend or someone else you know useful. It's likely that you will think of multiple actions, for which you will need to include multiple rows. Take as much time as you need, and include everything you can think of.
You might plan to start today, tomorrow or a later time in the week/month. Keep your plan realistic by taking into account any time restrictions. For example, if the action happens to be ""Work out each day at 6am"" you are unlikely to find it helpful to work towards this goal today if it's already afternoon by the time you've thought of it. Anticipate potential problems and strategize to overcome them. Consider any difficulties that are likely to occur with the action steps in your plan and devise a plan to handle them as they happen. For example, if you decided to pick the ""Work out each day at 6am"" action but know it's a pretty sure thing that when the alarm goes off you're only going to press the ""snooze"" button and give in to the temptation to doze off again then you could jot down something like ""I'll just fall asleep again"" .
Alternatively, you can think of solutions which have worked well at some stage in the past. However, if you know deep down something is highly unlikely to work as a strategy from past experience (for example, promising yourself you will talk yourself into getting up early next time when this has already failed on a number of occasions) - discard the idea.
By trying to re-use methods which already have not worked, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  Move on to other ideas. For instance, it's possible that setting your alarm clock some distance away from where you sleep could be more successful in waking you up as it takes more effort to switch it off. Update your progress report regularly and review the plan. Start your actions and implement your decided problem solving strategies at the planned times. When carrying them out, make a note of the date and whether or not the result was successful. Once the time period for your plan elapses, look through the progress comments you logged during that time.
When reviewing your plan think about what parts went well and what didn't go so well. For the things that didn't go well, ask yourself if there is anything useful you can learn from the experience(s) to move you towards your goals and incorporate this into your plan for next time.
If you have not learned anything useful from the experience, drop the current strategy and try an alternative.  Return to the earlier suggested methods and think up new ideas, if you are struggling with this. Reframe your mistakes. Even if you totally bombed your first attempt, it's worth it to keep pushing towards reaching your goal of becoming more self-disciplined. But, growing will require reframing mistakes into learning opportunities. Just don't give up!
Researchers found that there are two potential brain responses to making mistakes: immediately strive to problem-solve or shut down. People who pay attention to their mistakes are more likely to learn new ways of correcting them in the future. People who overlook (i.e. or shut down neurologically) their mistakes do not change or improve them. Be sure to look closely at where you're lacking and think of how you can improve in the future."
dkbcflnc,"Complete your education. At the very least, earn a high school diploma or GED. If you can, however, consider going for a college Associates or Bachelors degree. This will improve your chances at landing a well-paying job that you enjoy. Afterwards, you can even go back to college and earn a Masters or PhD degree. This will improve your chances of landing that job.
Find something you love to stick with in school, and this will likely give you a purpose in your adult life. Get a job. Diligently search online job hunting sites, newspaper classifieds, or get to know people in your field that might have job opportunities for you to start earning a paycheck. Once you have a job, get to work on time every day, do your work consistently, and find opportunities to learn; this will show your worth as a responsible employee.
Submit quality cover letters and resumes that show your education and experience when applying to jobs.
Don’t forget to ask questions in job interviews, and research the company ahead of time. Become financially independent. Get a job with a consistent and large enough paycheck to cover all of your expenses, and don’t rely on parents or others to provide for your bills, spending money, or other finances.
You may have to cut back on a few luxuries at first, such as going out every Saturday night, until you earn a higher wage.
Learn how to budget your expenses. This will help make you more financially independent. Get health, vehicle, and renters/homeowners insurance. When you’re of age, research and choose an insurance company for your health insurance and start paying premiums. If you have or plan to get a car, house, or apartment, you need insurance to cover those things, too.
Insurance is important because it will help keep costs down in the case of emergencies.
In some instances, you may not be able to own a car or rent an apartment without insurance. Find an apartment/house of your own. Find an apartment or house to rent or buy by searching online, in newspaper classifieds, or at an apartment finder service. You should find something that charges reasonable rent and that’s in a condition and area that makes you feel safe and healthy. Ideally, choose something that is close to work and other activities, and that you can afford to live in without roommates.
Keep in mind that you often get what you pay for. If something is cheap, make sure that it's not a scam and that the surrounding area is safe. Have reliable transportation. Depending on what town or city you live in, buy a vehicle or find public transportation routes that you can easily use. You can find less expensive used cars at used car dealers, online, or in newspaper classifieds. You can often buy bus, train, or subway passes for less when you buy them for frequent use over long periods of time.
If you plan on taking public transportation to work, check with your employer so see if they cover monthly passes; some employers offer that as a benefit. Travel the country or world. Save money and plan to travel to new places in order to experience new things, people, and ways of life. Seek committed relationships. Focus on committing to both friendships and romantic relationships that you see as lasting, with people that are also mature, responsible, and kind to you. Don’t waste time on flings or with people you know won’t last, and cut out anyone that brings out the worst in you.
Keep in mind that not all relationships will work out. If a relationship starts to turn toxic, cut it off; don't let it drag on. Take responsibility for your actions. Recognize that everything you do has a consequence, and you are in control of the outcome of your life through your own words and actions. See that both good and bad actions, and their outcomes, are your choice.
For example, if you want to get into a great college or university, you have to do well in school.
Alternatively, if you talked back to that former boss of yours, you won't be able to use him/her as a reference for a job you really want."
hvqombiu,"Ask for more responsibilities. There's a lot to do around a house. Garbage needs to be taken out, dinner needs to be prepared, the floors need to be swept and cleaned. If you want to be a more mature member of your family, ask for more responsibilities and take them really seriously. Do your best work and take pride when you finish.
If you have a pet, you should be in charge of the pet, not one of your parents. If you have a dog, you need to clean up after the dog, walk the dog, and feed the dog. Not just today, but every day.
Talk to your parents about an allowance if necessary, but focus on doing the jobs first, not getting the money. The more you make it about helping out, the more likely you are to get a good allowance.
Ask your parents if you'll be allowed to get a house key. This can be a big step for a lot of kids in becoming more grown-up. As you get older, you may ask for more responsibilities, like getting a part-time job, a car, and doing more things by yourself. Volunteer to help with chores. Most kids want to avoid chores at all costs. Mature kids know that chores are things that have to be done, even if they're not fun. Help out your parents whenever you can by volunteering for chores, to make life a little easier for them. This will make you seem very grown-up.
Help with yard work in the spring and summertime, or help rake leaves in the fall when they're on the ground.  You can also shovel the driveway if there is snow during the winter months.
Keep your room as clean as possible. Tidy up after yourself when you make a mess. Keep your toys and school supplies clean, and in their proper place.
Bonus: Help clean up other people's messes as well. If you help pick up after your sibling instead of whining about it to your parents, that will seem very mature. Listen to your parents. Mature kids respect their parents, which means they will be treated with respect. Immature kids whine and complain, making their parents' jobs much more difficult. If you want to act more mature, listen to what your parents say. Listen even when you don't like it, and then do what you're told.
Be honest with your parents as much as possible. If you don't think it's right that you should have to clean your room on a Saturday, tell them so. But don't whine and cry about it like a little kid. Write out your reasons. Tell them clearly.
Never make your parents ask you to do something more than once. If you're acting up and they tell you to be quiet, be quiet. Immature kids are unable to control themselves, but mature kids are. Stay calm when something goes wrong. Some little kids will fall to pieces whenever they don't get their way. Maturity means being able to accept bad news and take it in stride.
If your parents tell you that you can't go somewhere or do something specific, calm down. Don't yell, but speak honestly. Say, ""I'm disappointed, but that's okay. Thanks anyway."" Often, maturity like this can even get parents to change their minds.
If you get into a fight with a sibling, relax and take a few deep breaths. Don't overreact. Act like nothing bothers you and stay cool. This will take all the wind out of your sibling's sails. Be nice to younger siblings. Just because you're older doesn't necessarily mean you're more mature. If you want to act your age or act older than you are, then make a point of being nice and looking out for your younger brothers and sisters.
If your younger siblings don't know something, don't make fun of them for it. Show them how to play a game correctly, or how to do their chores the right way.
If you have older siblings, don't let them bait you into throwing fits. Sometimes, older kids like to pick on younger kids to try to get a rise out of them. When they provoke you, say something like, ""That's kind of immature."" Your older siblings will be shocked. Speak quietly and clearly. No whining, shouting, or baby-talking. If you're going to act like a grown-up, speak like one. Use a clear, firm voice when you have something to say. If you don't have anything to say, just be quiet.
Slow down when you're speaking, and think about what you say. Kids tend to talk very quickly and stumble over their words. Make sure to pronounce the words correctly, and learn how to say words that you're not sure about.
If someone is in another room, stand up and walk into that room to speak to them. Don't shout between rooms. Use mature table manners. Even if it's just a basic weeknight meal, it's important to sit still and be quiet during dinner time unless you are involved in a conversation. Dinner time conversation should involve everyone at the table.  Thank your parents, or whoever provided the meal, and eat it all. Wait until everyone is finished eating before you leave the table, or ask to be excused if you're finished.
Sit up straight at the table and put a napkin on your lap. Chew with your mouth closed, and put your utensils down between bites of food.
When dinner is over, offer to help clean the dishes. Before dinner, offer to help set the table, or do other simple tasks."
abfcqxzy,"Consider when the jealous comments are made. When your friend makes a critical or harmful remark, pause and think about what possibly triggered their spiteful comment. Were you telling them about something good that is happening to you? Did you just share your plans for the future? Had they just come from spending time with other people? After a few days or weeks, you will start to notice a pattern. Recognizing this pattern may help you know how to steer a conversation and or reveal your friend's insecurities.
If your friend always makes jealous, spiteful comments while hanging out in a group, they may put you down in an effort to bolster their waning self-confidence.
If your friend always makes envious remarks after you've shared plans with for your future, they may feel like their future isn't as promising as yours. Evaluate the content of their envious comments. Jealous comments reveal a lot about the person making the invidious statement. These comments, while directed at you, aren't necessarily about you. Think about content of the comments. What do they reveal about your friend's point of view and sense of self? Is your friend always telling you that you're not good at something? Do they frequently make fun of your appearance?
If your friend is super critical of your possessions, they may be struggling to define their identity outside of their possessions and finances.
If your friend makes negative comments about your success, they may be jealous about the opportunities you are receiving or envious of your talents.
If your friend constantly critiques your appearance, they may feel insecure about their own physical appearance. Speculate about what your friend is trying to achieve. Jealous comments usually serve a dual purpose. First and foremost, these remarks are meant to make you feel bad about yourself. You should also consider that your friend may be mad at you, building herself up by cutting you down, or trying to manipulate you. There is also the possibility that your friend treats everyone they encounter in this manner.
Your friend could be mad at you for numerous reasons, petty or otherwise. Is there a reason your friend might be angry with you? Did you recently fight? Did you forget to call them back? Were you gossiping about them?
In order to diminish and distract from our own faults, insecurities, or fears, we have a tendency to point out other's failings. Is your friend struggling with self-confidence or body image issues? Are they feeling unsure about their future?
Cutting someone down can make a person feel more powerful and confident. Does your friend thrive on feeling superior and in charge? Differentiate between jealousy, negativity, and depression. Humans are complex beings. Our emotional, mental, and physical health are interconnected and inform our mood, actions, and words. While you may perceive your friend's comments as jealous statements, there may be more to their envious quips than meets the eye. Instead of writing your friend off as jealous and petty, ask your friend how they are doing.
Some people struggle to manage their negative thoughts. If your friend is constantly comparing themselves to you, they may caught in a cycle of self-doubt and self-loathing. Their seemingly jealous remarks are making them feel worse instead of better about themselves.
Recent studies suggest that individuals struggling with depression have a difficult time distinguishing between negative emotions. If they truly are envious of you, they may not identify their actions or comments as such; if they are angry or sad, these emotions may manifest as jealousy."
stvzoeju,"Be direct. If you suspect you’re being manipulated, don’t get baited into a pointless charade. Give your friend a chance to clear the air by asking them what they want without mincing words. A good friend will be honest—a scheming one will try to rationalize everything they say in an effort to stay in control.
Avoid playing head games. They're a waste of time, and the longer they go on, the more leverage an experienced manipulator will have to get you to do their bidding.
It’s usually a bad sign when someone isn’t willing to reveal their true thoughts or intentions.
Sometimes, even just being silent after a person tries to manipulate you can speak volumes. Keep a level head. Try not to take your friend's tactics personally. Respond calmly to their backhanded jabs or efforts to influence you. Feeling like you're being manipulated is enough to make anyone upset, but if you allow things to get heated, they'll just blow up into an even bigger issue. By maintaining your poise, you'll be more prepared to handle the situation productively.
Making you angry might even be part of their plan, since it affects your ability to reason.
Delay a confrontation until you've had time to cool off. Learn to say “no” without feeling guilty about it. Don’t give in to their self-centered demands—set firm boundaries. No matter how close you and your friend are, you’re not obligated to do anything that goes against your conscience or makes you feel uncomfortable. Once you get used to saying no, you'll shift the balance of power in the relationship back toward the center.
You don’t have to justify yourself or offer excuses. Simply say “I’m sorry, I can’t” and be firm.
There may be times when a friend, even a manipulative one, needs your help. Use your best judgment to decide when you’re doing the right thing and when you’re getting played. Stick up for yourself. People with manipulative personalities prey on low self-esteem. Speaking up when you feel challenged will send the message that you’re not going to be pushed around. As long as you have confidence, you won’t feel pressured to be something that you’re not.
For instance, if you know someone who constantly ridicules your fashion sense to make themselves look better, you could respond by simply saying “I like the way I dress.”
By going out of your way to accommodate a critical companion, you’ll only be doing their bidding. Do what’s best for you. There’s a big difference between taking advice and taking orders. Don’t be afraid to tell meddlesome mates to butt out if they make a habit of interfering in your business. At the end of the day, you’re the only one who can make decisions on your own behalf.
A true friend may not always like the other people you hang out with or approve of the guy or girl you’re dating, but they’ll never try to tell you that you shouldn’t see them.
Spend some time reflecting on your personal values and limits. What are you OK with? What goes too far? This can help you establish boundaries with your friend."
uxzihlfn,"Measure the quality of your relationships. Friendships take more effort to maintain as you age. You may find your social networks becoming wider, yet you may not have as many close, tight-knit relationships.
 You may have a few friends you’ve known all your life as well as some dedicated new friends from different points in your life. Look at how long your current relationships have lasted — both romantic and non-romantic.
Have you been able to maintain quality relationships for a long time?
Are you able to get through difficult periods and keep your friends around?
Have you had long-term, stable romantic partnerships?
If you said yes to any of these questions, you may be managing grown-up relationships. Reflect on your conflict resolution skills. Even the most mature adults get into arguments. How you handle the argument is more telling than what started it. Grown-ups know how to respect each other’s differences. They remain calm during tense situations. They can agree to disagree or compromise to find a solution. They also know when to apologize and forgive without holding grudges.
Keep in mind that there is a difference between being mature and passive. Just because you never fight back does not necessarily mean that you have grown up. Think about what you look for in a romantic relationship. When you're young and immature, it's all about the chemistry and fireworks. As you grow older, you may look for a partner who is as much compatible as they are exciting. Ask yourself the following questions. If you answer yes, you may be involved in a mature relationship.
Do you and your partner work through your problems? Do you apologize to one another? Can you forgive each other during arguments?
Do you and your partner make compromises? Do you accommodate their needs? Do they accommodate yours?
Do you and your partner respect each other’s boundaries? Are you both able to have separate social lives, hobbies, interests, and jobs without becoming jealous or controlling? Imagine your perfect social gathering. Where does it take place? How many people are there? What are you doing? When you were younger, you may have wanted loud, crowded parties at clubs or bars. As you grow older, you may find yourself seeking quieter time with your friends. Sometimes, you might still want that big party. Generally, however, you may find that hosting dinner and game night at your home is more entertaining.
If socializing and chatting is more important to you than partying hard and getting drunk, then this is a good indicator that you are growing up. Consider how you relate to children. As you grow up, you begin to separate yourself more and more from the younger generation. You may dislike their taste in music, clothes, or entertainment. You may find yourself disapproving of their choices in life. You may think that they are badly behaved compared to your generation. You may also might appreciate their innocence, play, humor, and freedom from responsibility that is often lost in adulthood. This shows that you are creating a difference between yourself, as an adult, and children. 
If you have children, you may start worrying about their future. Children often force people to grow up quickly, no matter how old they are. You may be more aware of how your  decisions affect their life, their behavior, and their future. Your decisions will start to include their welfare as well as your own."
bayuyokd,"Define the project's purpose. A project management report should outline the project's scope and end goal. Understanding the objective is key to comprehending the needs that this project hopes to meet. It is important for you and your audience to have a clear notion of the project's purpose to maximize the effectiveness of your report.
Ask yourself, “How will this help my company, our client, or our community? Will this project possibly have a positive impact in other areas?”
Understanding the overall scope may help you appreciate how this project may be useful to you and others. Pinpoint your audience. Know who will be reading the report and what they may wish to learn from it. Some details may be extraneous to certain audiences, while others may need to be provided with detailed information. Identifying your readers at the outset will provide direction for the project report content.
Some audiences may not be familiar with the language, terms, and jargon often used in your working environment.
If you are writing a report for a client, for example, avoid using technical jargon that requires lengthy explanations.
Instead, plan to write in a voice that easily describes your project scope and timeline. Create a table of contents. A table of contents essentially provides an easy-to-read outline for your audience. At a quick glance, a reader can quickly understand the structure and substance of the document. A table of contents can also help busy readers find the information that is significant to them quickly and effectively.
Perhaps an investor is reading the report to review the budget. Showing where the budget is in the table of contents will help them find what they need fast. Talk to your supervisor. Have a meeting with your supervisor to understand the expectations of your project management report. Your supervisor may have particular points of interest, concerns, or details that they would like for you to include in the report. Try to collect as much useful information as you can to help make your report clear and useful.
Your supervisor may also explain how long the report should be and if there are particular formats that your company requires for these types of reports.
Ask your supervisor about what to include in the report. Your supervisor will appreciate the opportunity to give you feedback early in the process."
lzjmkdxb,"Think through your decisions so you don’t act impulsively. Whenever you’re given multiple choices, take a moment to consider each of the options. Make a mental list of the pros and cons of each choice and think about what you’re trying to achieve from your decision. Consider all of the actions you can take rather than settling for one that’s easier. Once you think over all of the choices you can make, choose the one that's most beneficial to the end goal you want to reach.
If you aren’t sure what option to choose, ask someone that you trust to see if they can offer any advice.
It’s okay to make spontaneous decisions every so often, such as hanging out with friends when they ask you if you aren’t busy or eating at a restaurant instead of cooking a meal.
Be firm in your decisions so you seem more reliable and don’t fall victim to peer pressure. Work on controlling your anger or frustration so you don’t act out. When you feel angry or frustrated, try taking a few deep breaths to calm yourself down so you don’t yell or get argumentative. If you need to get some space, try walking away for a few minutes to clear your head and look at the situation with fresh eyes. When you need to address someone or something that makes you angry, talk through what you’re feeling without raising your voice.
Realize that it’s okay to feel angry or frustrated, but it’s not okay to act out because of it. State your feelings rather than bottling them up and keeping them to yourself.Tip: Try writing down your feelings in a journal to work through them more. Include what made you angry, how you reacted, and how you felt afterward. Take responsibility for your actions if you make a mistake. Don’t let other people take the blame for your actions. If you did something wrong or made a mistake, tell the people it affected and apologize sincerely for your actions. Ask the people for forgiveness and see if there’s anything you can do to fix the problem. While there may still be consequences, other people will view you as trustworthy and mature.
For example, you could say, “I’m sorry that I knocked over and broke your vase. Will you please forgive me? Would you like me to buy you a replacement?”
Avoid lying to other people since people won’t be able to trust you as easily. Stay positive and optimistic to help you through hard times. Rather than focusing on the bad or negative qualities of something, try to focus on the positive aspects. Reframe bad experiences you’ve had to think about what you’ve learned from it and what you can apply it in the future. If you have trouble staying positive, try making a list of things that make you happy or events you’re looking forward to so you can cheer up.
For example, if you fail a test, you may be upset because you didn’t do well. Instead, focus on what you can do to improve your score on the next, such as studying more or reading things more carefully.
Having a negative attitude can make other people think you’re immature and not want to spend time with you.
Failure is a regular part of life, so it’s okay for it to happen every so often. Keep an open mind so you don’t judge others. If someone says something you disagree with or are confused by, ask questions about it rather than judging them for their choices. Try to see things from their point of view so you can get a better understanding of them. In addition to that, push yourself to do things that are out of your comfort zone so you can experience new things and learn about new things.
Learning new skills or picking up a new hobby can help you broaden your horizons even more.
Do things that are out of your comfort zone so you can learn and grow more mature.
Try to surround yourself with people who have different backgrounds and viewpoints. Act humble so you don’t seem jealous of other people. Avoid trying to one-up other people or showing off since it can make you seem self-centered. Keep any jealous feelings you have to yourself rather than vocalizing them. Try to recognize things that you have or have earned so you can feel more proud about yourself and what you’ve accomplished.
Don’t try to actively seek attention since it can make it look like you’re trying too hard to be mature."
tajcptfn,"Understand the top-down approach to project budgeting. There are two approaches to creating a project budget. The first is known as the top-down approach, and this refers to projects where the total allowable cost is known before the project begins. The project budget must therefore be within those costs.
For example, assume you own a construction business, and a large organization approaches you to see if you can enlarge their parking lot. They may tell you that they have $500,000 to allocate to the project, at which point you need to decide if you can do it or not. 
In the top-down situation, you would need to create a budget that costs less than $500,000. Understand the bottom-up approach to project budgeting. The bottom-up approach is the alternative to the top-down approach, and this refers to figuring out what every part of the project will cost, and then adding it up to determine the total. 
If a customer approaches you to re-build a parking lot, and asks for a quote, you could use a bottom-up approach. You would consider everything that is necessary for the project, and then determine the total cost.
In this case, you determine the cost of the project by figuring out what every piece will cost and then calculating a total. In the top-down approach, the cost is determined by available resources, and you must work within those limits. Choose the approach for you. Sometimes, you may not have a choice, and you may need to work within the confines of somebody else's budget (meaning you would need to use a top-down approach). Other times, if you have full control over a project, you can select an approach.
The advantage of the top-down approach is that it ensures a project is completed within available resources. If your organization has $1 million to spend on projects for a year, you can state that the new parking lot construction project must be done for under $500,000. These limitations can lead to efficiencies and the reduction of waste.
This approach is useful if you have limited resources. Similarly, if you are running a project, it allows you to dictate to all the parties involved how much they are allowed to spend. This can keep costs down because each party will not be creating their own budgets.
The bottom-up approach is useful because it can be very accurate. Without any immediate limit, you, or your employees can cost the project based on what the project needs. If you are constructing a new parking lot, you may task each member of your team to come up with the budget they need. The major con is this approach can lead to run-ups in cost. Discuss the needs of the project with key stakeholders. Regardless of the approach you choose, you will need to discuss what the project will require with key project members. Knowing the needs of the project can allow you to determine what the costs of the project will be. This is called the ""scope"" of the project and it defines the requirements and limits of the work to be performed.
For example, assume you have been approached to construct a parking lot for a large organization, and they have allowed you to cost the project (or provide an estimate). Your first step will be to discuss with them what their needs are, and what their timelines are.
They may say they need a new lot with 100 spaces be constructed within three months. You may then survey the site to realize that you will need to cut down trees, blast rock, and then construct the new lot.
From this, you can determine you will need planners to design the lot, people to blast and cut down trees, and construction workers to build the lot."
zkcxlkrt,"Every day we're faced with countless decisions. In these moments we have to make the right choice - the safest, most comfortable choice. 
Imagine yourself in bed and your alarm clock goes off, and you have to get ready for school. Whether you're home schooled or not, just imagine yourself in that particular situation. Would you smack the snooze button and wish for another day, or would you get up, despite the sleepiness, and groom yourself for school? Decisions like this are complicated ones, and take discipline to complete."
xoefdyhn,"Create a communication system. Communication is important between you and your parents to clarify when you need privacy or space. A simple, predetermined signal can denote when someone needs a moment of breathing room.
You might say something like “I am feeling overwhelmed and need some privacy.” This will communicate to them what you are feeling and what they can do to help you feel better. Respect your parents' privacy. You should maintain your parents' privacy by being respectful of their boundaries. Follow their lead, if in doubt. For example, if their bedroom door is kept closed, keep yours closed as well. Although you are welcome at your parents' home, by inviting you to live with them, they are losing quiet moments and personal space that they once had to themselves.
Make a concerted effort to preserve their quiet, undisturbed moments and use them as an opportunity to have your own as well. Let your parents know your plans. Since you're an adult, you will want to go out with friends sometimes and might even stay out late. It will be helpful to establish with your parents that you will text them to let them know you will be out, and communicate with them beforehand to tell them about any plans you may have. Discuss potential houseguests in advance. It will be helpful to discuss potential friends you might invite over beforehand to avoid any conflict. While living in your parent's home, ensure that you, and anyone you invite into the home, abide by the rules of the house. Create a space for yourself. Whether it's your room, or an office/work area, it is helpful to have a space that is your own. Let your parents know that you'd like this area to be private and that you would prefer to be left alone in this space. Set a firm date to move out of your parent's home and stick to it. Pick a reasonable date to leave the house, even if selected arbitrarily, and let your parents know when you intend to leave. Follow your budget and build your confidence and skills while in your parents home, keeping the date that you chose in mind as a motivator."
nodtkgrg,"Find a healthy distraction. You’ll find it harder to avoid the urge if you simply sit and fixate on it. Instead, recognize the urge and actively try to distract yourself with something else. This can help distract your mind from the urge or craving and give you the space to truly decide if you want to act on that urge.
Sometimes doing something with your hands is helpful, such as crocheting, knitting, folding origami, or even texting a friend. Have a go-to activity. In addition to momentary distractions, actively try to replace the behavior you want to control with a substantive alternative. By giving yourself more time to take the decision, you can make a clearer, more empowered decision.
For instance, if you’re trying to stop spending money, you can go for a walk in a green space where you won’t even have the opportunity to shop. Or if you’re trying to control overeating, you can develop the habit of hitting the gym when the urge to overeat arises. Try belly breathing. This suggestion can come in handy if you are trying to quit smoking or curb your eating habits. If you have a cigarette or food craving, instead of immediately giving in to the craving, set your phone timer for five minutes, and focus on breathing from your belly. Remind yourself that a craving is just that, a craving, it is not a necessity. Take the five minutes of breathing to imagine the craving slowly disappearing every time you exhale. Take note of how you feel and if you still want to engage in eating impulsively or giving in to that cigarette.
Try closing your eyes and breathing in slowly through your nose. Continue filling your lungs, fully expanding your chest and lower belly. Finally, breathe out slowly and naturally—your mouth or nose is fine. Recognize impulsive thoughts. Having strategies to help you resist temptation in the moment will help you build self-control. Start by making a list of the behaviors you’d like to control and the situations that often trigger the behavior. By recognizing the moments when you get the urge to act impulsively, you’ll be more equipped to create a delay between the urge and action.
Take a look inward at what matters most to you and what your values are. Balance is going to look different depending on what your goals are, so try to achieve it avoiding impulsive thoughts. Place time restrictions on impulsive thoughts. Creating space in your thinking will help you reevaluate your actions from a more rational viewpoint. This will also help you learn how to create a delay in your actions instead of just acting upon your urges.
For example, if spending money or shopping is one of the areas that you want to build self-control, place a twenty-four-hour hold on any purchases before you buy anything. You can write down in a small notebook what you were thinking of buying and in twenty-four hours revisit your list and decide then if you really want or need the item(s)."
kwptzfqp,"Take stock of the things that your friend does that bother you. When you are alone, think about the things you’re your friend does and identify the reasons why they bother you.  Identifying these issues in the relationship will help you to work out strategies for how to cope and, hopefully, improve the relationship.  Does she often cancel plans with you at the last minute? Does she yell at you? Does she flirt with that guy that you like, even after you told her that you like him?
If you have trouble identifying exactly what your friend does that bothers you so much, you may want to discuss your friend with another friend or someone else that you trust. Deal with your emotions. After you have identified the things that your friend does that bother you, think about how those things make you feel. It is important to acknowledge the pain and other emotions that your friend has caused you and deal with those emotions in a healthy manner. If you refuse to acknowledge your emotions and deal with them, they may erupt in an unexpected or inappropriate manner. Determine whether or not the problem warrants a confrontation. Confronting your friend will be difficult for you and even more difficult for him or her. Before you decide to confront the person, think about whether or not the issue is a big enough deal to require a confrontation. If you confront the person and the issue is rather minor, you may end up looking like you are nit-picking and that can cause more problems in the relationship. Develop strategies for situations that do not require confrontation. Not all problems are worth confronting your friend about, but you should still prepare yourself to handle common situations that you think may not be worth a confrontation. Having strategies in place can also help you to feel more in control when your mean friend says or does things that upset you. 
If your friend often cancels plans with you at the last minute, make backup plans to lessen the damage of her canceling on you. 
If certain topics cause your friend to make rude or insulting comments, avoid discussing those topics with him or her."
cddaxapo,"Divide your project into components. The first part of calculating the man-hours you will need to do a job is to split up the project into smaller components. Then estimate the amount of hours needed to complete each component. These components should be designated according to the type of labor involved. If you are building an apartment complex, you will need excavation, construction, electrical, plumbing, and so on. Make sure that every component of your project is included in the estimate. Determine the type of workers you need. This largely depends on the complexity of the tasks that need to be accomplished.  You don’t need a foreman to do every job.  Some simpler tasks can be done by assistants or apprentices.  Figuring this out is harder for larger jobs that require a mix of labor to do tasks that range from simple to complex. Estimate the time needed to complete each component. Once you have determined your components and the types of labor each requires, estimate the total number of man-hours it would take your workers to complete a step from start to finish. Do not include breaks. This number should be the hours of dedicated labor it will take to finish a step.
If you are familiar with the type of work required in a step, you can draw from past projects to get time estimates. For example, if you know it took one worker ten hours to install four new windows, or 2.5 hours per window, your current project will likely be similar.
If a step in your project includes a type of labor you're not familiar with, you should do some research in preparing your estimate. Depending on the project, you may be able to get valuable information online or from another contractor. You can also hire a consultant familiar with the type of labor you need. This person can help you estimate the hours required in a certain step.
Factor in things like job difficulty when making your estimate. If the windows on your upcoming project are on the seventh story of a building, and your old project's windows were on the first story, increase your hours-per-window rate to reflect this difference.
Include estimates for time spent on administrative tasks that may be required by the contract. Include hours for supervisors.  You may also include project hours for a foreman or manager, who will lead the team of workers and manage reporting details and timeline compliance.  Some projects may require more than one supervisor or foreman, managing different components of the project.  Other projects may require different levels of supervision.  You may have foreman managing workers in different components of the project and an overall supervisor who manages all of the foremen. Use your estimates to prepare a project timeline. Your client will likely specify a time for completion of the project. Perhaps he will ask you to indicate in your bid how soon you can complete your work. You can use the steps and hours you have calculated to develop a project timeline. Determine which components can be completed simultaneously and which must be completed sequentially, where the input of one process depends upon the output of the previous process.  If you know when each step of the project needs to be completed, you can divide the number of hours needed to complete a step by the number of eight-hour workdays in the time period. You may be able to extend or shorten the project timeline by adding or removing laborers. The more laborers you have, the faster you can complete a step.
Some projects may require more than 8 hour days or 40 hours week to meet schedule.  They will require overtime which should be charged to the job
For example, if you have one month to lay the foundation of a new home, and you know the foundation requires 1000 hours of labor, divide 1000 by the number of eight-hour workdays in the month to calculate the number of laborers you need to hire to complete that step on time. (1000 project hours / 20 work days in the month = 50 hours per day; 50 hours per day / 8 hours per worker = 6.25 laborers needed.) Round the number of laborers up or down to a whole number, and adjust accordingly the number of workdays required.
Be realistic about the number of workers you can hire in a given time period. If you need seven electricians to complete wiring in a week, this may be unrealistic, depending on the availability of electricians in your area. You may need to extend your timeline to accommodate the availability of labor for your project.
If you plan to complete multiple steps at the same time, you'll need separate laborers to work on each step. Prepare and submit your bid. Add the hours for each type of labor you need, so you have a total for each type. If you require just one type of labor, you can combine all of the project hours into one number. If you need multiple types of labor, your bid should specify the total hours for each type. You should include all labor costs including taxes and benefits. Some Federal contracts may require a minimum wage for each category of workers.  Also, include any markup you plan to charge.
As an example, imagine you have been hired to install a new kitchen in a medium-sized home. You have divided your project into steps, each requiring plumbing, electrical, and general construction work. Your bid should reflect the total electrician man-hours, plumber man-hours, and general-laborer man-hours, as well as the pay rates for each type of labor. Adjust your man-hour estimates as the work progresses. Because time estimates are really just guesses, you will need to update your estimates as your project goes along. You will probably bill your client based on the actual hours your team works, so you should provide your client updated hourly estimates as time passes. This helps prevent surprises for your client when billing time rolls around.
Include a ""fudge factor,"" which is an increase in estimated time due to unknown causes. The amount of fudge factor depends upon the complexity of the job, availability of labor, dependence upon outside agents, and the relationship of one process to another.
Most contractors make it clear that their bid is only an estimate, that actual hours will vary, and that clients will pay for actual hours worked as the job progresses. However, it is possible a client will want to pay you a lump sum based on your estimate and not pay for actual hours worked. Pay close attention to any contract language that would signal this kind of arrangement, as this requires very careful estimation on the part of the contractor.
If your client will pay you based on actual hours worked, remember that your bid served as an estimate, and that you should not charge for significantly more hours than you planned unless you can cite reasonable justification. If you run into problems and know you are going to go over your time estimates, keep the client informed in order to prevent miscommunication.
Have a written agreement that defines contingencies and out-of-scope work.  Include the process for identifying and approving these changes, such as necessary approvals and documentation."
lpealadl,"Keep in mind that selfishness can indicate other problems. Although someone who behaves in selfish ways may be frustrating to be around, it is possible that selfish behavior may indicate that the person is dealing with deeper issues, such as depression or narcissistic personality disorder. Try to avoid judging or labeling your friend as selfish and self-centered. Instead, try to find out what is going on in your friend’s life that may be causing him or her to behave in selfish ways.
For example, you might say, “You seem wrapped up in the negative things that have been happening in your life. What's going on?”
Encourage your friend to seek help if they're depressed or dealing with other serious issues. Advise your friend to talk to a school counselor or a therapist. Think about what’s bothering you. What does your friend do that irritates you? Does she say negative things to you, constantly demand your attention, or talk only about herself without stopping? Get a good handle on exactly what it is that bothers you about your friend.
Some friends ask for help but never give anything in return. In this case, they're taking more from the relationship than they're giving, leaving it one-sided.
Others talk themselves all the time but never ask how you are. If you do talk, they seem uninterested. This is another example of a one-sided relationship.
Another type of selfishness is attention seeking. They may constantly call you and try to get you to hang out. They don't respect your need for alone-time. Consider underlying problems. The underlying problems of selfishness may give you a little something to go on when talking to the person. You may also be able to develop a little more empathy for your friend if you consider why he or she may be acting in selfish ways.
Selfish or self-centered people may be insecure or have a negative self image. As such, they look for attention or try to get others to think about them.
Consider their childhood. Maybe they expect attention because that's what they're used to. Maybe they're desperate for attention because they never got any growing up. Think about times you’ve been selfish. Selfishness is a normal human behavior and we are all guilty of it sometimes. Think about times that you’ve been selfish to get some perspective. You may have been selfish unintentionally and hurt others' feelings. For example:
Have you ever interrupted someone during a conversation?
Have you ever gotten bored when someone else was talking and started thinking about a problem of your own?
Did you ever insist someone to spend time with you, even though you knew that they weren't feeling well?"

ajtctext,"Check to see what other people your age are doing. From an early age, people learn what is acceptable by looking to their peers. One way that you can tell if you're too old for something is to examine whether other people your age are doing it. If they aren't, you might want to give a little thought to why you still want to participate.
For example, if a lot of your friends have stopped going out and partying every night, it might be a good idea to stay in on a work night a little more often.
However, you shouldn't be afraid to be a trailblazer. Just because you don't know anyone else who's going back to school, for instance, doesn't mean that you shouldn't pursue your education, no matter how old you are. Take into consideration the reasoning behind a rule. When you're trying to decide if you're too old for something, think about why others might think there's an age limit. In some cases, you might find the argument valid enough to change your mind.
Some guidelines, like the risks involved in having a baby after a certain age, are rooted in science, and are hard to deny. However, someone's opinion that you should have children soon because ""you're running out of time"" should have no bearing on your decision about when to start a family. Consider the source when you're thinking about the reasoning behind a rule.
Similarly, a law that says you must take a vision test each year in order to maintain a driver's license exists because people's eyesight fades as they get older, so you have to comply with that. However, if you can see perfectly well and you still have an excellent reaction time, you shouldn't let anyone tell you that you're too old to drive.
Other rules, such as being too old to get a nose ring or play with dolls, are more of an unspoken social guideline, and it's not as important to follow them. Follow rules that are in place for safety reasons. Sometimes, unspoken social rules are in place to protect you. If that's the case, it might not be worth the risk to try that particular activity. Instead, look for another outlet that will give you a similar feeling while minimizing your risks.
For instance, there's a reason that some high-octane activities, like skateboarding or parkouring, are usually performed by young people. That's because as you get older, it's harder to recover from an injury or a fall, so unless you're in really great shape, you're taking an extra risk by participating in an activity like this. Instead, you might try cycling or swimming to get an adrenaline rush without as much danger.
Other safety-related rules might include avoiding activities that are meant for children once you're fully grown, like riding on a small plastic toy or jumping in a bounce house. Be realistic about your situation. No matter how young you might feel, eventually you will probably have to face the reality that you aren't as young as you used to be. When you're making a decision, you should be realistic about what you can and can't do, and consider your health in the future as part of your plans.
For instance, if you're in your 40s and you're thinking about starting a family, you'll face different challenges than if you were in your 20s or 30s. This doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but you should have an honest discussion with yourself about whether you have the energy to keep up with a toddler.
Usually, people who are alike fare better in terms of dating.
They have a more stable relationship if their energy levels, ambitions, intelligence, values, and education are similar.
As another example, it might not make sense to quit your job and start a new career if you're only a few years away from being able to retire. However, if you'll only be happy if you start your own ice cream truck, don't let anybody tell you that you're too old to do it. You might just need to wait a few years until you reach retirement so you'll have the security you need to pursue your dream.
You should also take into accounts your financial responsibilities when you're deciding what's realistic. You shouldn't default on your debts and ruin your credit just because you feel like you're getting too old. Listen to your body. When you're trying to decide whether you're too old for something, it's important to take into consideration how you feel physically. If you have chronic pain or an old injury that limits your mobility, certain activities will be more difficult for you, no matter how young you are at heart.
If you experience frequent back pain, for instance, you should take that into consideration when you're thinking about activities like mountain climbing or whitewater rafting.
On the other hand, if you feel great physically and you're in good physical health, you shouldn't let anyone tell you that you're too old to try something new!"
elsuiitz,"Identify all the necessary project stakeholders. A stakeholder is anyone who will be affected by the project. This is a long list of people ranging from the project sponsor down to the individual employees who will work on the project. There are a few stakeholders you should identify and communicate with throughout the process.
The project sponsor is the person or business that provides the funds for the project. They usually own the end result. Usually the sponsor has to sign off on all big decisions.
The management team are the ones who oversee the project. Usually each member of the management team heads a division that carries out specific tasks to complete the project.
End users are people who will use the project when it's finished. Visitors to a building, for example, are end users. You usually don’t meet with end users, but you should take their potential concerns into account while planning the project. Meet with the upper-level stakeholders to work out the project's goals. In this pre-planning stage, work out a clear definition of the project goals by speaking with its stakeholders. You don’t have to meet with every stakeholder, since many are lower-level employees. But you should speak with stakeholders at the management and ownership levels. You’ll have to meet their expectations with this project.
Speak with the project sponsor to understand their expectations and work out the project goals. Begin by consulting with them.
Meet with the management team before drawing up concrete plans to understand the budget, timeline, necessary resources, and risks of the project. If the managers bring up any concerns about the project, take them seriously. They are the ones who have to carry the project out and can identify potential problems. Define the project’s scope to plan how you will complete it. The scope is the intended result of the project. What will this project accomplish when it’s completed? What objectives will it meet? Having a clear idea of the project’s scope is crucial for planning what steps you’ll take to meet those goals. In speaking with the important stakeholders, get an understanding for what the intended project scope is.
For instance, a project scope could be building a new luxury apartment building. All the subsequent planning will build towards this end result.
Make sure the project scope is feasible. For example, if a sponsor wants to travel to Mars next year, this is probably not a manageable scope. Talk with the sponsor and inform them of what is currently possible, and then work out a scope you can meet.
If the sponsor is not entirely sure what the intended scope for the project is, help them work it out. Speak with them and the project managers to come to a conclusion on what the end result should produce. Divide the project into key milestones. Once you’ve defined the scope, you can identify the milestones the team has to meet. Milestones are large tasks that progress chronologically. When one milestone is met, another begins.
If the goal is building an apartment building, important milestones would include purchasing the land, getting the building permits, laying the building foundation, constructing the frame, and so on until the building is completed. Identify all necessary milestones like these.
List the milestones in the order they have to be done. For example, you can’t lay the foundation until you have construction permits. Keep your project flow organized like this. Draw clear lines of communication between project stakeholders. Communication is crucial during the entire project process. Different people and departments should have clear lines of communication so every manager is informed of the project’s progress. Before you even start writing the project plan, identify who is in charge of each task and who reports to whom. This will help your team run much more smoothly so they can complete the project on time.
Part of this workflow is making sure people aren’t bothered with problems that aren’t in their department. For example, the person responsible for landscaping around the building doesn’t need to know if there was an issue with the phone lines in the building, so they shouldn’t be contacted if such a problem occurs.
Plan on writing this communications workflow in your project plans so all participants know who to contact if they need information."
cvknhicl,"Be assertive, not a doormat. A common theme for those who befriend egotists is being unable to stand up for themselves. But, if you want to maintain this friendship, you will have to stop letting your self-centered friend walk all over you. Learn to be clear and brief when you state your needs.
When your friend asks your advice, actually give your opinion.
Practice saying “no.” If you don’t agree with something or don’t want to do something, say so. ""No"" is a complete sentence. This means you do not owe your friend an explanation for the “no.”
Don’t feel guilty. Everyone has the right to speak up for themselves. Call them out when they’re rude. If you’re friends with an egotist, you are probably no stranger to being the butt of mean, sarcastic jokes. Your friend may laugh it off like they’re just teasing, but these comments are rude. One way to set boundaries is to speak out when your friend does this and let them know you refuse to be treated this way.
You might say, “Hey, that’s not cool, Frankie. I’m going to leave if you don’t stop.” Don’t feed into their arrogance. Egotists really like being the center of attention. However, just because others in your social group eat up their every word doesn’t mean you have to. Stop giving them special treatment. Instead, treat them the same way you treat all your other friends.
Let’s say someone asks what you’re doing for the summer and the egotist interrupts and starts telling about their summer plans. Politely say, “Actually, Donna, I think Judy was asking me that question.” Then, go ahead with your answer. Limit the amount you compliment them. Egotists like to make everything about themselves. The more you compliment them and point out their positive traits, the more you enable their high opinion of themselves. Dish out compliments when appropriate, but don’t feed into their need for more.
If they fish for compliments, don't bite. Limit the time you spend with them. People who are self-conceited are often described as “energy vampires” because it drains you to be around them. If this characterizes your friendship with this person, start getting some distance.
For example, if you’re having a tough day and don’t have the energy to deal with them, back out of your plans.
It may seem rude, but you need to do what’s best for your emotional health and your sanity.
It may be beneficial for your friendship to revolve around a hobby or an activity. This will help you limit the time you spend with them by keeping your relationship focused on the activity. Make sure your expectations are realistic. If you want to continue being friends with this self-centered person, you may have to lower the bar. Take advantage of the feel-good vibes you often get from hanging out with this person, but know your limits. Don’t expect the egotist to ever support you emotionally or show any concern for your needs.
Also, limit what you confide in this person. Unlike non-egotistical friends, they may not understand the importance of a secret, which means they just might share it with others or throw it back in your face later."
znmochbe,"The key to saying “no” is being honest with yourself. It’s completely normal and okay to have a weak spot—everyone does! Think about what temptation or situation always seems to get the best of you, whether it’s hitting the snooze alarm too often, spending too much time on social media, or something else entirely. Admitting your weakness helps you  take a step in the right direction. Here are a few examples of possible weaknesses:
Playing video games instead of focusing on schoolwork
Skipping a trip to the gym to hang out with friends
Watching TV instead of going to bed at a good time
Taking on an extra task at work even when your schedule is booked"
owvqqlpn,"Accept responsibility for your actions. You should take responsibility for your actions, whether they are intentional or unintentional. It is a sign of maturity and respect for others. Everyone makes mistakes. Failing to accept responsibility may seem like a good idea at the time, but in the long term it will not benefit you.
For example, if you accidentally back into your neighbor’s car when pulling out of your driveway, let them know by writing them a note or knocking on their door. Then, correct your mistake by submitting the claim to insurance or paying for the damage. Show people respect. Respect your partner, family members, friends, and strangers. Children are often selfish and disrespectful. As you grow up and mature, you should understand the concept of respect and why it is important. Giving respect will also give you more respect in return.
Respect people’s right to have their own opinion, even if it differs from your own.
Listen when other people are speaking.
Be sensitive and respectful for other people’s feelings.
Keep your promises and commitments. Develop a way to handle conflict maturely. When you are faced with a conflict, it is important to keep your emotions in check. Control your anger and avoid becoming belligerent. Take a deep breath, listen, and work through the conflict with the other individual.
Give yourself time to cool down if you are really angry. This will prevent you from saying and doing things that you shouldn’t do in the heat of the moment. Receive feedback positively. People learn and grow by receiving feedback and criticism from others. You should accept that you don’t know everything and that feedback from an expert is not meant to hurt you. It is meant to help you.
For example, thoroughly read through your edits on your research paper. These edits will help improve your writing in the future."
pvpwbmss,"Distract yourself with a healthier activity. Distraction is a great way to avoid temptation because it shifts your thoughts to something else. If you aren’t thinking about your temptation, it’s easier to say “no.” Choose a distraction that you enjoy so the temptation will lose its appeal.
For example, let’s say you’re tempted to eat a second slice of dessert, even though you know it’s unhealthy. You might distract yourself by engaging in your hobby or calling a friend.
Let's say you just broke up with your partner and are tempted to text them, even though you know it's a bad idea. You might instead start a conversation with a friend or distract your attention with your favorite hobby. Tell yourself you'll indulge your craving in 15 mins, then delay it longer. This helps you avoid giving into temptation until your craving passes. It's easier to wait 15 minutes than it is to think you can never have what you want, so you can use this technique to trick your brain. Eventually, your craving should fade away
For example, let's say you're trying to lose weight but you keep craving candy. Set a timer for 15 minutes, then start doing another task. Keep delaying the treat for 15 minutes until you aren't tempted anymore. List the consequences of giving into your temptation. Imagine what will happen if you give into temptation. What will your life look like in the long run? How will you feel tomorrow? Facing the consequences can help you resist whenever temptation arises.
Let’s say you’re tempted to cheat on your partner. You might imagine yourself telling your partner and losing your relationship. You could also list the other things you’d lose, like your good reputation, friendships, and time with your children, if you have them.
You might be at a party where you're tempted to use illegal drugs. Imagine getting caught by your parents or police. Consider what could happen if your school or job found out. You might get kicked out of your school activities and may have a harder time getting into the college you hope to attend. Visualize yourself resisting the temptation to increase your resolve. Picture yourself saying “no” to whatever is tempting you. Imagine that you’re successful in resisting, and picture yourself reaching your goals. This helps you feel like resistance is possible.
For example, let's say you're trying to save money for a trip, but you feel tempted to buy an expensive new pair of shoes. You could visualize yourself walking out of the store without making a purchase. Then, imagine yourself reaching your savings goal and going on your trip.
Keep your visualizations positive. If a new obstacle arises in your mind, imagine yourself overcoming that, as well.
Using visualization takes practice, so it might not feel as helpful at first. Keep picturing yourself being successful, and you’ll start to believe it. Label your temptation so you can confront it. Denying a craving will only make it worse because you won’t be able to stop thinking about it. Instead, acknowledge how you feel. Think about why you might feel that way, and then list other, healthier ways you can satisfy your needs.
For instance, you might crave sugary snacks every afternoon when you feel an energy slump. Tell yourself, “I really want candy right now because I’m tired. I can get a similar boost by drinking green tea, instead.”
As another example, let’s say you’re tempted to have a one night stand even though you’re in a relationship. You might say to yourself, “This person is very attractive and I haven’t been feeling satisfied lately, so I’m thinking about going home with them. Since I want to save my relationship, I’m going to think of a few ways I can feel closer to my partner.”"
ejjcxydy,"Accept the challenge. You’ve probably heard many grumpy adults tell you that your generation is ungrateful and immature. This attitude is, like your becoming a young adult, just another natural transition in life. Their generation (and each before it) was filled with 18 year olds who didn’t want to grow up. Though this transition has always been difficult for humans, it is still very important to accept the challenge. Life isn’t always enjoyable, but maturing proactively can make it a little easier. Learn to respect your parents (or your guardian). This is important, firstly, because they are probably the most emotionally and financially equipped people to offer help when you need it. There are also larger reasons for respecting your parents. You have a lifelong bond that can be an incredible source of strength for everyone involved. Sure, you may have quarreled while you were growing up, but it’s time to do the adult thing and put your differences aside. Find mentors. The emotional and daily struggles you have as a young adult have been around forever. You’re not the first person to experience them, so check in every now and then with an adult you look up to. They can help you through problems and offer advice on how to ‘be an adult’ in a given situation.
Having a mentor to talk to is also an important part of maintaining mental health. The early adult years are when you are most susceptible to showing signs of mental illness. Let someone help you keep your blossoming feelings under control. Research and explore career options. The key to surviving the work culture of the 21st century is forgetting the clichéd question “what do I want to do for the rest of my life?” Almost no one these days will work for one company their entire life, much less have anyone job title. Many jobs that are available right now might become obsolete in the future.   The best thing to do at 18 years old is think about general tasks you enjoy, and environments you enjoy being in. See this guide for a detailed description of the process of choosing a career.
For example, if you keep your room tidy and keep track of all your expenses, you may enjoy a job in logistics or data management.
Your ideal work environment may be as simple as indoor or outdoor. Or, for example, if you enjoy concerts, you should look into careers in audio engineering or event planning.
You shouldn’t forget about your teenage dreams and hobbies, but most people aren’t going to become successful rock stars. Consider putting off spending too much time on unrealistic dreams until they are a viable way to earn a living.  If you do want to follow your dreams, you can try following your dreams in a more ""scaled down"" and realistic fashion.  For example, you may want to become a rock star, but think about starting a band and playing in your local community at a local coffee shop or lounge, etc.
Getting a part time job while you explore your career options is a great idea. Just don’t get complacent with a job that doesn’t fill you with self-respect just because it puts a few bucks in your pocket. Look into ‘adult’ hobbies. It is important to have fun, but you should start thinking of ways to enjoy the world as an adult. There is a world of culture that you may have previously found dull or uninteresting. Now that you have matured some, try those activities again and see what all the rage is about – there is probably a reason ‘adult’ hobbies have been around so long.
For example, try to spend less time watching cartoons and more time reading.
Or, try going to a music concert that is not rock, hip hop or pop music.
You don’t need to force yourself to tolerate activities you still don’t enjoy, but try to expose yourself to them and see how you like them. Move into an apartment you can afford. If you live in an area that allows you to move out of your parents’ house, do it! You may have to have roommates the first few years, but see that as an opportunity. Unlike high school friends, who often move in opposite directions, the friends you make as a young adult are probably there to stay. Roommates you have as a young adult can become lifelong friends. You will learn to be mature and responsible. Check out this guide for more on choosing an apartment.
Look at the neighborhood. You want to factor in accessibility, safety, public transportation, and nearby amenities.
Make a budget. After rent, utilities, renter’s insurance, and any other housing related expenses, you shouldn’t be spending more than one-third of your monthly income.
Find roommates at a similar place in life. You may be able to successfully live with older or younger roommates later, but keep your life more simple by rooming with like-minded people in this phase of your life.
If you’re still in high school, you shouldn’t move into an apartment just yet – this advice is for a little later. Make short-term and long-term goals. Think about where you want your life to be in five years. This will be important in giving your life a sense of direction, but don’t feel bound to it. As the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans. Therefore, write down where you want to be in a few months, or next year. This should be a smaller, more achievable goal that will make your daily life more enjoyable.
Long-term goals involve personal relationships, whether or not to attend college, being in an ideal career or job title, etc. These should be something you strive for, so making a plan is a good idea. However, be aware that your plan will change. For example, marriage may happen when you don’t expect it to, and not happen when you want it to. Be ready to roll with the punches.
Short term goals may simply be, for example, that you want to start a weekly exercise regimen by next summer. Or, you may want to simply get a part time job in the next couple months while you explore career options."
cbdsjsej,"FTE is the number of full-time equivalent hours all your employees work. For a 40-hour workweek, a full-time employee that works 40 hours counts as 1 FTE. A part-time employee that works 20 hours a week counts as 0.5 FTE. If you add all of the weekly hours of your employees and divide it by the hours in the workweek, you’ll determine how many full-time equivalent employees your business has.
You can find the FTE for any amount of time. To get FTE for the year, divide the total annual hours worked by 2080, which assumes a 40-hour workweek for 52 weeks of the year. To calculate for the month, divide by 173.33, which is equivalent to 2080 hours divided by 12 months.
You can also use an online calculator if you don’t want to manually calculate FTEs.
For the most accurate FTE calculation, hire a tax lawyer or accountant to calculate them for you."
jxlinnrh,"Throw yourself into your talents. What makes you unique? What makes you you? Use your late teenage years and early 20s to start becoming more and more like the adult version of yourself. Your interests, talents, and skills will give you some sense of who you will become, so it's important to take your mid-to-late teenage years to explore those talents and dream your biggest dreams. What do you want to be? Who do you want to be? Explore yourself.
Use these years to play in bands, play sports, act in drama, paint, and read for pleasure. Explore things for which you have natural skills, as well as things you know nothing about. Try new hobbies and activities that are available, like photography or dance. You might learn that you're really great at something you never gave yourself credit for. Start thinking about where you'll be in 10 years. While you don't need to plan out your whole life in your early twenties, it's important to start giving some thought to what you want to do with the rest of your life. Do you want to go to college? Are you studying what you want to study and providing yourself a plan for the future? Do you want to start making money as soon as possible? Are you going to take your band on tour and live like a rock star? Are you going to travel? Make a list of your priorities and the things you want to make sure to accomplish in your young adulthood and start taking the steps to make them happen.

If you're interested in going to college, start researching possibilities, and thinking about what you'd like to study. Find local universities and colleges that might be a good fit, and find colleges that would be dream schools. Find out about how much it will cost, how much your family will be able to afford, how much you'll need to reserve with student loans, and the different cost breakdowns for different schools.

If you want to start working, spend time developing a budget for yourself, setting financial goals, and learning what kinds of jobs will be available to you to make the kind of money you'll need. Research the training and vocational skills you'll need for those types of jobs so you can start preparing now. See new places and embrace new experiences. In the interest of expanding your mind and learning more about the ways different people live in your world, it's important to see it up front and in person. Make it a priority to visit other places and spend time in other cultures as you enter adulthood. It can be a moving and significant experience for many young adults.
Traveling doesn't need to be a leisure activity for the privileged. If you work hard and can't afford to take a vacation to Italy, or study abroad, travel as best you can within your means. Visit interesting places in your own country that you've never seen. Visit neighborhoods within your own city that you don't spend time in. Be a tourist in your town.
World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) takes on willing laborers in a variety of countries throughout the world, giving you a chance to work your way across the world. Likewise, the Peace Corps, Americorps, or other humanitarian organizations provide service and travel experience. Help out, give back, and see new places. Befriend a diversity of people you respect. Give yourself a chance to socialize with as many different kinds of people as you can. Learn about yourself from spending time with hard-working and admirable people, and model your behaviors on people you respect. Maintain healthy relationships and you'll maintain your own sanity.

Find a work role model. At your job, find a person who negotiates the work environment in a way that you admire. Learn from them. If your colleague stays above the petty department politics, but still manages to let her work speak for itself, do the same. Collaborate and commiserate.

Find a life role model. As you grow older, it's easy to lose touch with old friends and to not make new friends. It's easy to wake up one day and realize the people you see every day are coworkers. Keep friends that do very different things than you, with whom you share mutual interests or hobbies. Maybe your record collecting buddy works HVAC, but that doesn't mean you can't relate to each other over the new crate-digging finds you made last weekend. Be honest with yourself. As you get older, you'll gradually get to know yourself better. If you tend toward laziness, or tend to sweat the small stuff, or tend to procrastinate, these things shouldn't be a surprise by the time you reach your twenties and get ready to enter the work force. A teenager can get away with ignoring these things and calling it ""youth."" But an adult needs to get real and be honest about shortcomings, challenges, and places for growth. Growing up takes work.

Identify your strengths. What are you particularly good at, or skilled in? Take time to identify your personal strengths and the things you're proud of.

Identify your weaknesses. What needs some work? What keeps you from getting what you want? It's important to identify places in need of improvement, fixing up the foundation to keep the house of yourself strong."
hmtgktky,"Use mistakes as an opportunity to learn and grow. As you transition into adulthood, you're going to make mistakes—and that's okay! It's just a part of growing up and making your way in the world. Analyze your mistakes so you can figure out how to avoid the same situation in the future.

Eliminating negative self-talk is a big part of having a growth mindset. For example, instead of saying, ""I'll never be able to do this,"" you might say, ""I messed up that time, but I know I'll figure it out eventually.""
Whenever you mess up, own up to it! You miss out on the opportunity to grow and learn if you make excuses or blame it on something or somebody else."
rpsdptcp,"Examine other people’s motivations. When somebody calls you a child, think about why they said it. Is it your physical appearance? Did you do something that would cause them to say it? Knowing why people perceive you as a child can help you work on looking and acting more mature. If you can't identify a reason, ask the person politely why they called you a child.
Don't get angry with them. Tell them that you are trying to act more grown up, and ask for advice. Say something like, “I know I’m younger than you are, but I’m trying to be more responsible and mature. Can you tell me why you still consider me a child?”
If you think you do know why someone called you a child, ask them to verify this. You may have assumed the wrong thing. Say something like, “Do you still consider me a child because of my age/appearance/way of talking?”
The person who thinks of you as a child may not be willing or able to offer you an explanation. Don’t let this bother you. Keep acting mature, and eventually, these people will see that you aren’t a child.
The motivation for calling you a child may not have anything to do with you personally. They could be jealous, insecure, or want to hurt your feelings for other reasons. Keep your cool. Don't yell, cry, or otherwise react emotionally to someone calling you a child. This will make you look even more like a child to them. If you are mad, walk away, or if you think you can do so calmly, explain to them what bothered you. Think about whether it is worth potentially having an argument. In most cases, the best way to prove the person who considers you a child wrong is to not let their behavior bother you.
Tears cannot always be helped. If you feel them coming on, excuse yourself. Step outside or to a quiet place to compose yourself. If you cannot walk away because you are at work or school, take some deep breaths. Try to change the subject. If you're still upset later, you can revisit the issue with the other person when you are feeling calmer. Convince your family you’re not a child. Possibly the most difficult people to prove your maturity to are those who see you on a daily basis. Your parents, siblings, and other family members may have known you your entire life, and it’s often just as difficult for them to start considering you as an adult as it is for you to accept them treating you like a child. That’s no reason to give up on acting more mature. Eventually, even your closest family members will see you as an adult.
Your parents may be the most difficult to convince you’re growing up. To them, you’ll always be their child, but your parents likely want you to be happy and more mature. Let them know how you feel about being called a child. Say something like, “I want to start acting more like an adult. It hurts my feelings when you call me a child. What can I do to make you think of me as an adult?”
Older brothers or sisters may also see you as still being just a child, and it can be difficult to get away from them since you’ll likely see them every day. This makes it even more important for you to remain calm. The best way to convince older brothers and sisters you’re not a child is to ignore them when they call you one. Don’t argue with your siblings about being a grown up. Just keep acting like one. They’ll come around.
You can give evidence of why you think you are no longer a child. This can help convince your family to change their view of you. For example, you might say, ""I have a job and pay all of my own bills and rent. I think that means I should be considered an adult now."" Take on new responsibilities. Start by making sure you’re being responsible with all of your current activities. Don't forget to do your homework. If you're in a play, don't forget your script. Remember your clothes for dance lessons after class. If you’re already keeping up with all of your current responsibilities, consider taking on some additional responsibilities to show people you’re not just a child. This can include volunteering for a leadership position in a club or organization you belong to, doing more to help around the house, or getting a part-time job.
Don’t over extend yourself. Take on one new responsibility at a time, and once you’re sure you have it under control, you can consider other new responsibilities.
Choose new responsibilities that you care about. It will make the added work easier. For instance, if you enjoy theatre, volunteer to work as a stage manager.  You may want to select responsibilities that contribute towards long-term goals. For instance, volunteer or find an internship in your field or industry.
Do whatever you can to not only complete your new responsibilities, but to go above and beyond to show you are committed. For example, if you need an event plan for a club you’re in charge of in place by next Friday, get it done this Friday. Treat others with respect. Even if you feel disrespected, treat other people with kindness and understanding. It may not always be easy when people are treating you like a child, but showing others respect, even when it’s unearned, is an important part of being an adult. Treating others with respect can be as simple as remembering not to demand or expect things from other people. Instead, ask for them, and say thank you.
Start small. Say please and thank you. These are two of the easiest ways to show your respect for others. Say things like, “Please pass the salt,” instead of, “pass the salt.” By adding please, you are asking instead of demanding. Always say thank you, if someone responds to your request.
Recognize other people are busy by saying something like, “I know you have a lot going on right now, but I would like to see a movie this weekend and could use a ride.” To express your gratitude, you can offer to do something in return.
Say, “I’m sorry,” if you upset someone. Don’t get defensive and argue. Instead, say, “I’m sorry I upset you. I didn’t mean to.” React with maturity. For example, when you get a present you hate, don't make it obvious. Say thank you and put it aside. Keep it simple. If you get an ugly sweater for your birthday, say, ""Oh thank you, it looks really warm."" That's all. Don’t go on about how you can’t wait to wear it, as this may come back to haunt you when you have to wear the sweater every time you see the gift giver. If you receive a grade you’re not happy with, don’t storm straight up to your teacher’s desk and demand a better grade. Instead, take at least 24 hours, review any notes your teacher made, and calmly ask your teacher, “I was really surprised by my grade. Can we talk about it, so I can do better next time?” Set goals for yourself. One thing that many adults do that young people don’t is consider where they will be in a year, five years, ten years, etc. Consider long term goals and set achievable tasks that help you get there. This will show people in your life that you are serious about being more mature and making more adult decisions. Start small and build your way up to more advanced or long term life goals. Make a list of things you can accomplish in a day, a week, a month, etc., and keep track of your progress.
If you always procrastinate your assignments in class until the last minute, set a goal to finish your task a week early. Create calendar reminders or ask a friend or family member to hold you accountable.
If you want to attend a specific college, start finding out as much as you can about the college right away. Look up their application requirements, talk to a guidance counselor, and set up interviews at the school.
Share your progress and accomplishments with family and friends along the way. This can help boost your confidence and motivation. It can also help others respect you more, which may help them see you as an adult. When sharing these accomplishments, try not to brag. Consider volunteering your time. Sometimes, working with others to achieve a goal or improve your community will help you better understand what you need to do to improve as an individual. This may seem strange, but getting outside of your own head and seeing the big picture is a great way to think and act more like an adult.
If you are unable to volunteer for a charity or institution, you can make a difference by offering to help someone in your life. Try to give advice regarding things you have expertise, experience, or wisdom in."
lsxpghue,"Talk in private.  Pull your friend to the side and away from the earshot of others to have this talk.  You don't want to risk embarrassing them or having your business aired out to everyone. Ask them to meet you after school or call them at a time you're both free.
Say “Hey Sarah, do you have a few minutes to talk after school?  I was thinking we could get ice cream.  I wanna chat about something.” Begin the conversation gently.  Avoid jumping straight to the issue; ease into it instead.  Spend a few minutes chatting about their day or the latest news. Once you are both comfortable, you can talk to them about the copying.
You can say “Lately, I've been feeling like every time I buy a shirt or pair of shoes, you go out and buy the same ones.  I've tried to ignore it but it's been bothering me and I wanted to talk to you about it.” Listen to their side of things.  Once you have opened up, listen to what they have to say.  Don't interrupt them, and even when you feel that they are wrong, try to see things from their perspective.  This 'copying' could be a coincidence, or perhaps the items that you have are very popular and worn by many people.
They might also admit that they've been copying you.  If you tend to get more attention or are more confident, them copying you could be a way to feel cooler.
Remember that you friend may be copying an aspect that they admire about you and that it's not necessarily a bad thing. Encourage them to be an individual.  If they do admit to copying you, let them know that you're not mad at them.  Talk to them about the reasons you two are friends and the things that you like about them. Encourage them to express those things rather than copying your personality or style.
For instance, you might say “Kris, you have such a fun personality and I don't know why you'd want to change that to be more like me.  I want to be friends with YOU, not a copycat version of myself.” Manage any defensiveness.  Your friend might not have taken this news well.  They might be offended that you think they are copying you.  Even if they yell or get upset, keep a completely neutral tone and demeanor so they don't get more agitated.  Base all of your feelings in facts so that you have examples to back them up.
If they say that you're crazy for thinking they would copy you, say something like “In two weeks, you bought four of the same shirts I have.  You even cut your hair in the same style as mine.  Maybe you didn't notice what you were doing, but it does seem like you're copying me.”
When they make valid points, let them know that you understand where they're coming from. End on a high note.  After this talk, try to be positive.  Your friend might be feeling a bit low after the chat, but do try to reaffirm your friendship.  Hug it out and then give them some space to think.  Text or call them the next day to check in.
Say something like “I'm glad we could talk about this.  Thanks for hearing me out.  I still want us to be friends; that hasn't changed.  I'll call you tomorrow, okay?”"
jeylkabo,"Choose a living arrangement. When you move away from home, you have a lot of options for how and where you would like to live.
Dormitories are a great option for college students and are often required for freshman at many institutions. Dorms let you ease into living away from home without saddling you with tasks like rent and maintenance. They're also excellent places to make friends and learn how to live in a community of your own.
Single apartments require the most responsibility right off the bat but they also allow you to have a space that it is entirely your own. Studio apartments, which are small and inexpensive units with one main room and one bathroom, are good first apartments, as are one-bedroom units. To avoid loneliness, you'll have to seek social interactions away from home if you choose to live alone, which can be more challenging.
If you don't wish to live alone, sharing an apartment or house with roommates is your best option. This not only reduces your living costs, it also gives you a good balance between community and privacy. Learn to cook. Cooking for yourself is much more cost-effective and healthy than relying on takeout and store-bought meals. It's also a great social skill and will be essential if you ever choose to have a family of your own. There are a lot of different ways to learn to cook and you can use multiple methods at the same time. Look for:
Cook books.
Online instructional videos.
Online recipes and instructional articles.
Local cooking classes. Keep your space clean. For the sake of health and social presentation, it's very important to have a clean home and an equally clean self.
Wash dishes daily. Allowing dirty dishes to pile up just creates more work for yourself down the line and increases the amount of mold and insects in your home.
Do laundry every one to two weeks. If you don't have laundry facilities in your home, look for a local coin-operated laundromat.
Designate one day a week as cleaning day. This is a day when you should thoroughly clean your home, including washing floors and windows, cleaning your bathroom, dusting your furniture, and any other tasks specific to your home.
If you have roommates, divide up cleaning chores and rotate them equally. Set clear rewards and penalties for success and failure to fulfill these responsibilities."
qjjjhcjh,"Clarify all specific rules, regulations, and guidelines as soon as possible. If you have any questions whatsoever, don't wait to ask them. Waiting to get answers can lead to redundant or useless work, or, even worse, doing the wrong job on accident. Make sure you clarify everything up front.
When possible, get this information in writing so you can turn back to it if you forget.
Get the contact information of your teacher, product manager, or client right from the beginning and ask if there is a good way to get in touch if you have later questions. Draft your overall goal or finished product before beginning work. In order to effectively get to the end of the road you need to know where you are going. Brainstorm and write down what your vision of the completed project looks like whether it is a thesis idea, an organized spreadsheet, or finding your company a new warehouse. This will help you draft the steps needed to get there.
Use this time to make sure your plan is realistic for your time frame -- a big part of finishing on time is picking a project you can actually finish.
If you don't know quite where you're going yet, that's okay. For example, if you haven't decided the topic of a presentation yet you can still sketch out goals. You might not know the topic yet, for example, but you know you must go to the library and start researching one.
Your ""final project"" may change between now and the end -- the goal isn't to get a perfect project idea now, it's to create a blueprint that you can work off of. Make a list of all of your necessary materials, when they're needed, and how to get them. You can't complete a project until you have the stuff needed to actually do the job. Once you know what actually has to be done, make a master list of the things needed to do it. It can help to share this list with your team, if you have one, crossing off supplies as you get them. Make note of:
The item
Quantity needed
Date needed
Purpose
Cost
Location/store to buy
Any special considerations (color, size, etc.) Break the full project into smaller, more manageable goals. Make a list of steps and things that need to get done. Finding your company a new warehouse, for example, is not something you just walk out and do. You need to discuss your company's specific needs, contact a realtor, decide on a warehouse, get it inspected, and then complete important tax, mortgage, and real estate paperwork. Whether you're working alone or as a team, you can better budget time and money to these five smaller tasks than one enormous one.
Make your goals measurable. Instead of ""find out what my boss wants for the warehouse,"" make specific goals to learn the right location, budget, size, and essential amenities.
You may have no idea how long it takes to buy a warehouse, but you know that talking to your boss takes one day, finding a realtor 2-3 days, inspection 1-2 weeks, etc. It's much easier to budget time for smaller goals than big ones. Set dates to complete your smaller goals by. If your project is due on May 31st and you have ten different things to do, you don't want to be completing all ten of them by the 31st. Figure out what things you can have done by the 10th, which ones you can finish by the 20th, and what things have to wait until the end of the month to complete.
In general, people are most effective working on one task at a time, not 10 at once. Check off each goal one at a time instead of working on all of them at once for maximum efficiency.
Most projects have work that can't be finished until other work is done. You can't, for example, write a book report until you've read the book. Figure out what work has to get done ahead of others and prioritize that. Give yourself more time than you think you'll need. Things will invariably go wrong -- an item you need is out of stock, something breaks, last minute plan changes, etc. Don't schedule yourself so that you're under the gun every single day of work. Whenever possible, build an extra 1-3 days in so that you can adjust when complications arise.
No one was ever upset to finish a project ahead of schedule. If you plan for extra days and don't need them you simply get a few days off."
vpcvqfhi,"Analyze yourself first. Work out what things stand in the way of you being more disciplined at the moment. They may be character flaws, an inability to articulate what you want out of life or a preference for losing yourself in stimulants or addictions. Perhaps you conform too much without thinking for yourself; this can make it easy to follow someone else's ideas of discipline without working out discipline that works for you and fulfills your own real needs. Whatever the reason, try to determine it first.
Why do you feel you are not disciplined enough now? What are the factors standing in the way of you being more disciplined?
Journal about your thoughts so you have a chance to comprehend them better.
As well as assessing your own limitations, consider how others in your life impact you. Are you pleasing others too much to spend time on yourself? Are you always giving in to other people's wants and letting yours go by the wayside? Seek to convince yourself that you want to learn discipline for the purpose of believing in yourself. This is especially important if you spend a lot of time just pleasing others. It will be a lot more difficult to stay disciplined if you feel you need others to form boundaries for you or to tell you how to act and think or what to do.
What voices in your head tell you that you're unworthy or a failure? These are negative thoughts that have no basis and need to be tackled in order to introduce self care and discipline in your life. You may need counseling or it could be sufficient for you to work through your negative thoughts using mindfulness or cognitive behavioral techniques."
lwvrbchy,"Dress like an adult. Act the part by investing in clothing that makes you feel like a grown-up. Trade in your band shirts for collared button-downs, go for a nice blazer instead of a denim jacket and invest in a nice pair of shoes.
Go shopping with an adult and ask for their opinion on your selections. Look for clothing that is high quality and well made. Fast fashion or trendy styles may look good at the moment, but it's a smarter move to invest in pieces that will last you longer than a few weeks.
Put some effort into your appearance by doing your hair, making sure your clothes are clean, and putting cologne or perfume on. Keep your living area clean and tidy. Messy living spaces can make you feel like you are living in a college dorm room, or a kid’s room. Clean up the sink full of dirty dishes or the piles of laundry lying around your room or apartment. Reduce clutter by re-organizing your space to be more functional. Focus on presenting a clean, organized living space.
Look at How to Organize Your Bedroom and How to Deep Clean a House for tips and tricks for keeping your space clean. Find a mentor. A mentor is someone who gives help and advice to a less experienced person. A good mentor will help you build your self-confidence and self-worth. They will teach you new skills or help you improve the skills you already have, and act as a role model or someone you can look up to.
Reach out to your guidance counselor at school, or to your community leaders. You can also look for a mentor in a family member or a close family friend.
Look at programs like the Boys and Girls Club, which connects young people to role models and mentors in their community. Learn a new skill. This could be cooking, driving, or even crocheting. Focus on building your self-confidence by learning more about a skill or activity that interests you.
Obtaining your driver's license is a big step to becoming more responsible and independent. You no longer have to depend on someone else, such as your parents, to drive you around or adhere to someone else’s schedule when you need to get to a date or an important meeting.
Even if you decide not to get a car, having your license means you always have the option of renting a car for a trip or driving someone else’s car as their designated driver after a night out.
Getting better at cooking is a great way to gain more independence and become more confident as a person.
Start small and tackle small dishes like a sandwich for lunch or stir fry for dinner. Look online at simple recipes that take under 30 minutes to prepare. Offer to cook for your parents one night, or for a friend to show off your new skills. The more you practice cooking, the more confident you will become in the kitchen. Take control of your finances. This is a big one, but most adults have their finances under control and in order.
Set up a meeting with a financial advisor to discuss smart ways to invest your money. Create a budget, broken down by month. Focus on putting as much money as possible into your savings account. This money could go to other very adult things like a car, a home, or a big trip.
Avoid splurging on clothing or other unnecessary items. This will show the adults in your life that you are serious about being responsible for how and when you spend your money.
Taking control of your finances will also benefit you as a person and give you more self-confidence in the company of other adults."
bzfstbcr,"Ask your friend to have a private conversation. Before you make any decisions, it's important that you get to the bottom of the situation. Tell your friend that you'd like to clear some things up, and that you'd appreciate them meeting with you.
If you don't see this friend at work or at school, ask them to meet you in a public place such as a cafe. It's best to meet in a public place so that neither of you feel uncomfortable.
Always talk to your friend away from other people. You can't have a serious conversation about your relationship issues when other people are around. Speak calmly. Yelling or getting overemotional won't typically help your situation. Talking in a calm voice will help you get your point across and will also help your friend remain calm. We often think much more logically when we are calm, so you'll be able to better explain your thoughts and feelings if you don't let your emotions get the best of you.
Stay calm by taking slow, deep breaths – deep breathing is a great tool to keep you relaxed.
If you start to become upset, calm yourself down by internally telling yourself to relax, and/or thinking of imagery that keeps you calm – such as a beach or waterfall.
Carry a stress ball to squeeze when you get angry. This is a great way to physically get out your anger and tension in an extremely calm way. Tell your friend what you've heard. Avoid mentioning names and simply tell your friend whatever you heard they did or said. Express to them how those actions hurt you. The more straightforward you are, the more straightforward they'll be.
Seek the truth before you make your final decision. Most of the time, we find out about backstabbing friends through other people. It's important to get your friend's side of the story before you take another person's word as fact. What you've heard about your friend could be a rumor, or it could be true. Either way, it's important to know the truth. Listen to your friend's side of the story before making assumptions. Tell your friend that honesty is important to you and your friendship, and that you'd like to know the truth. Use open-ended questions to encourage discussion and avoid verbally attacking your friend. If they feel like they have to be defensive, they won't be honest with you. Simply ask what happened and listen attentively.
Keep in mind your friend might not have even realized they crossed a line. Tell your friend how you feel. Be honest with your feelings and don't beat around the bush. Be straightforward when you're telling your friend why you're upset with them and how their actions have made you feel. Remain as calm as possible.
Use this guideline to express your feelings: ""It upset me when you _______. Your actions made me feel like _______ because _______."" Ask your friend if you did something to bring about their backstabbing. It's important to know whether you have somehow contributed to the issue at hand. Perhaps they feel hurt by you in some way and this is their way of ""getting back"" at you, or perhaps there has been a misunderstanding. It's important to clarify the possibility that your friend sees things in this light.
Avoid interrupting. Let your friend finish talking before you interrupt them or ask additional questions. It's important that your friend feels heard. Don't turn the conversation into an argument. If your friend won't answer your questions or continues evading the issue, gently push them for answers, but do not attack them. If you turn this into an argument, it will only cause your friend to withdraw from the conversation. Your friend may feel embarrassed that you found out about their actions, so they may be hesitant to be honest with you.
To avoid arguing, be sure to listen to your friend instead of waiting for your turn to talk. Listening to one another will give you both a better understanding of what happened.
Don't raise your voice. This will just get both of you upset.
Don't focus on who is right and who is wrong – focus on truth and honesty. If you're trying to prove one another wrong, you won't have a productive conversation. Instead, be honest with one another to figure out how to fix the current situation.
Don't be disrespectful or condescending. Even if you're upset, it is not okay to disrespect someone, especially if you're trying to fix a problem. It is important to treat your friend the way you wish to be treated.
If things start to get tense, suggest taking a short break from the discussion to allow yourselves to cool down. Get a trusted opinion. Talk to someone else you trust, such as a parent, a spouse, another friend or even a counselor. Discuss what happened with someone neutral who can give you an honest opinion on the situation. Sometimes when we are emotional, we can overlook things that an uninvolved person might notice. It's important to talk with someone who will be honest with you, and not someone who will only tell you want you want to hear. It's also important that you listen to them. Determine if the friendship is worth saving. If your friend is open and honest with you about their actions, there's a strong possibility that your friendship is fixable. If you and your friend can admit to your mistakes and commit to working on a better friendship, put in the effort to fix things. All of our relationships have their ups and downs, so look at conflict as an opportunity to improve your communication and make your friendship stronger.
If your friend is not willing to be honest about their actions, or if this is a recurring issue with this person, it might be best to go your separate ways. Friendship is a two-way street, and you can't be the only person putting in the effort to keep it going."
kylbupho,"Tell yourself that being a woman is a mindset. Being a woman is not just about the body you are developing: it also has to do with the way you think and feel about yourself. It might take a lot of time and hard work before you feel like a true woman, but there are steps you can take to make the transition. Read coming-of-age books by and about women. The world is constantly changing, and there are a lot of things to learn. Consider purchasing or checking out of the library books that can help orient you to the world of womanhood. Pay attention to the memoirs and autobiographies of women you respect.You will be exposed to the challenges they faced, which will help you confront your own challenges. Learn appropriate social skills and behaviors. If you act like an adult, not only will you be treated like an adult but you will also have higher self-esteem. Some key steps you can take include:
Avoiding procrastination. Take responsibility for your commitments, and complete your tasks in a timely way.
Having good manners. Behaving in a kind and polite way can help set the stage for a responsible adulthood.
Standing up for yourself. Politeness is important, but it does not mean that you should be walked all over. Learn how to express your views with confidence, even if the people around you are not behaving as politely as you are. Act with confidence. While women tend to underestimate their abilities, men tend to overestimate their abilities. This is known as the ""confidence gap."" Keep this in mind as you enter adulthood: even if you feel nervous about a task, you might very well be the most competent person in the room. Some ways you can overcome the confidence gap include:
Seeking out female role models. Find women in leadership positions who can help you learn leadership skills of your own, such as how to speak with confidence, how to supervise a team, and how to engage in constructive criticism.
Not letting your ""niceness"" keep you down. Kindness and politeness are important skills for adulthood, but women are often told to be nice and polite at the expense of their knowledge and expertise. Try to find a good balance between acting kindly and sticking to your guns.
Speaking confidently. Practice speaking to others with power and confidence. Stand up straight, project your voice, keep eye contact with your listeners, and speak in definitive tones. Resist the urge to make your definitive statements sound like you are asking questions or asking for permission (""uptalk"").
Passing it on. Just as young women depend on other women for leadership skills, you have the potential to be a key role model for younger generations too. Pass along your unique knowledge and skill sets to a younger woman who could benefit from it, and continue to hone your leadership skills. Learn about the world. Being up-to-date about important current events and news items is a great way for you to appear knowledgeable and responsible. You will have lots of material for adult conversations and will also begin to learn about your place in a much larger world. This can also help you decide what your values are as you enter the world of adulthood. Consider:
Reading, watching, or listening to the news regularly.
Find journalists you respect and follow their stories.
Read well-researched nonfiction books about topics you care about.
Make your own conclusions. While you will have to get your information from other sources at first, eventually you will be able to analyze events on your own. If you are old enough to vote, you can vote for the candidates and policies that align most closely with your own. If not, you can find other ways to get involved, such as by writing, signing petitions, or volunteering with organizations you care about. Take part in a coming-of-age ritual. Most cultures have some kind of important ceremonial marker to designate when a boy becomes a man or when a girl becomes a woman. These rituals can help make a young person feel like an adult and a full-fledged member of a community. Whether it is a Sweet 16 party, a Quinceanera, or a Ji Li, these rituals serve as a significant turning point in the life of a young woman. Depending on what culture you identify with, you might want to plan a coming-of-age ritual or party to mark the beginning of your life as a woman and to bid farewell to your girlhood. Make goals for yourself and live up to them. It is important to set independent goals for what you want your life path to look like. These goals might be different from your parents' goals and they might be influenced by your friends and peers instead. You might even set goals that are completely different from those in your family or peer group. Perhaps the most important marker of a mature woman is that she lives according to her decisions and values. Think carefully about what you want out of life, and make a plan to live up to those goals."
hhcixdvr,"Stay calm. When someone is moody, it doesn't help them if their friends are also tense or upset. It is unlikely that your friend's moodiness is the result of something you did, so don't take it personally.
If you feel yourself getting upset or tense, use some calming techniques before talking to your friend. Taking slow, deep breaths is a well-known way to reach a calm place. You can also try counting backwards or actively counting your breaths. This will distract you from a stressful situation and help you center yourself. Ask what is wrong. If your friend is normally even-tempered, their moodiness might be caused by something that is happening in their life. Maybe they are sick or tired. Maybe they've failed a test. Sometimes just knowing someone cares is enough to bring them out of their funk.
Make sure your tone says you are asking because you care. You can try stating what you see, then asking if everything is alright — ""You don't seem to be yourself today. Is everything OK?"" or ""Your reaction seemed a little over-the-top. You OK?""
Your friend might not be able to articulate what is causing them to feel sad one minute and happy the next. But just trying to put it into words will often take the emotion out of the situation and help your friend get back on an even keel. Ask what you can do to help. Your friend might just want a hug to feel better and you won't know if you don't ask. Or maybe they just want someone to sit and listen without judgment. Asking if you can help will also make your friend realize that their moodiness is being noticed, and sometimes that is all it takes for a person to change their mood. Change the setting. If you friend is feeling sad, a change of scenery can help. Try taking them out for lunch or plan a fun activity with other friends. If you friend is laughing inappropriately or feeling manic, suggest that the two of you go someplace quieter. Ask if your friend wants you to stay or leave. Sometimes moody people just want to be left alone until they feel better. Other times they want to talk. Ask your friend and let them guide you.
If your friend asks you to leave, be sure to check on them later. You don't want them to feel abandoned."
yedgbhil,"Discover your talents. If you're feeling inadequate or immature, it probably stems from not finding and pursuing your true talents. Part of becoming an adult, in this sense, is reaching a degree of independence. Start by trying several jobs or activities to find what you're naturally skilled at. For example, you might volunteer at a hospital and discover that you're great at working with people or handling difficult situations. This might lead you to pursue a career that's people-oriented.
Studies suggests that the people who are happiest with their lives find their natural talents and pursue them. This is more important than choosing a career based on popularity or income. Recognize that your life is unique. Since no two people ever follow the exact same life path, your own development as a person will be unique. This can be difficult to appreciate since people live in communities and societies that often have expectations and age-related milestones. For example, your society might expect you to get an education, find a job, and start a family, in that order. Or, you might be expected to care for a family member instead of starting off on your own.
It can be hard to know what to do when social expectations conflict with what you'd like to do with your life. Remember that research suggests that those who are happiest with their lives aren’t necessarily those who chose their career path based upon its prestige. Figure out what you're passionate about. Find which activities, people, or things make you act with the most enthusiasm and passion. This will help you feel more independent and competent in your daily life. Avoid simply acting on an impulse. Instead, give some thought to what you're already motivated by and learn to use these abilities.
For example, you may realize that you're passionate about teaching others. Use this knowledge to look for opportunities to use that enthusiasm. You may tutor classmates, teach in a school, or go to school to become an educator.
If you're not sure how to figure out what you're passionate about, try thinking about the things you enjoyed when you were younger. You could also think about things that you dreamed about but thought would never be possible. Think about what makes you happy. Start by making a list of as many happy situations you can remember. Write down as many details regarding the events as you can remember. A list will help you figure out what it was about these situations that made you happy or energetic. You may notice that you were with the same few people. Or, maybe you found that you enjoy figuring out challenges. Since different things make different people happy, it's important that you know what you enjoy.
For example, your list might have something like playing video games, playing the drums, or painting. This might lead you to realize that you're happiest when you're working with your hands. Become independent. This is especially true if you're a young adult, relying on your parents to support you. Take steps to take care of yourself and your needs. This might mean getting a job to support yourself financially. Or, if you notice you're lonely, schedule time with friends to get some company.
Avoid relying on others to take care of you and look after your needs. Part of growing up is recognizing that you are the one that's responsible for you.
Once you're supporting yourself, it will become easier to make your own decisions and stand by them. Make your own decisions. While you're growing up, others often make all your decisions for you, be they major or minor ones. Part of becoming your own person is moving to make your own choices. You might start with smaller choices, like which classes to sign up for in school or where you want to eat. Gradually, start making larger life decisions for yourself.
For example, if you're unhappy in your job, you can decide to quit or change careers. Or, if you're tired of living with your parents or a roommate, you can decide to move out on your own."
kfutxhwh,"Change the subject. Sometimes redirecting the conversation can curb bragging behavior. If your friend starts bragging, change the subject to something you both find interesting. Maybe you could talk about a class you're both in or a book you both love. You could even compliment a mutual friend and encourage the bragging friend to praise others.
If your friend continually turns the conversation back to themselves, politely tell them you don't want to talk about that right now. You don't have to tell them why.
You might say, ""Very cool, Jacob! Hey, have you seen the trailer for that new superhero movie yet? It looks pretty awesome. What kinds of movies do you like?"" Avoid competing with them. If your friend is always one-upping you, you may feel the urge to brag back. This will only worsen the problem: your friend will want to best you and you will feel even more angry. When you feel the urge, hold your tongue. Stooping to their level will not help.
Never lie about your accomplishments in an attempt to best them. Even if they don't find out, you will likely feel bad for lying. Set an example for your friend. If you notice yourself bragging, correct yourself out loud and avoid bragging in the future. Apologize to your friend and say something like, ""I didn't realize I had been bragging. I'll try not to do that in the future. I know it makes people feel bad."" If you make an effort to stop, your friend might follow suit.
Even if your friend knows they have a problem, they might feel too embarrassed to change their behavior. Knowing that other people struggle with it, too, can push them towards improvement.
Do not brag on purpose just to self-correct yourself. This is passive-aggressive. Your friend may not necessarily pick up on the hint, but they may pick up on your anger. Instead, become self-aware of your own bragging habits. Don't insult your friend. People often don't realize how their bragging hurts others. Your friend might not mean to hurt your feelings. Treat them kindly and with respect. Ganging up against them will not solve the problem.
If your friend only brags on occasion, try your best to just be understanding. Everyone wants to brag from time to time. We all want to share our accomplishments and our life's high points with friends and family.
If your friend is emphasizing the point that they have achieved or received something that you clearly cannot have or do, that is not okay. In that case, have an appropriate conversation to tell your friend how you feel. Change the way you compliment them. How you praise them can either reinforce or curb their bragging behavior. Complement their actions rather than them. Saying, ""You're so amazing!"" may give them incentive for bragging in the future. Instead, say, ""You did a good job!"" It puts emphasis on the action, not them, and encourages them to work hard.
If your friend is fishing for praise, you do not have to compliment them. Treat them kindly, but put attention on something else besides their actions.
You might say, for example, ""I appreciate how much effort you put into the group project, Becca. We couldn't have done it without your persistence."""
